    "title": "Using augmented reality to elicit pretend play for children with autism",
    "abstract": "Children with autism spectrum condition (ASC) suffer from deficits or developmental delays in symbolic thinking. In particular, they are often found lacking in pretend play during early childhood. Researchers believe that they encounter difficulty in generating and maintaining mental representation of pretense coupled with the immediate reality. We have developed an interactive system that explores the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) technology to visually conceptualize the representation of pretense within an open-ended play environment. Results from an empirical study involving children with ASC aged 4 to 7 demonstrated a significant improvement of pretend play in terms of frequency, duration and relevance using the AR system in comparison to a non computer-assisted situation. We investigated individual differences, skill transfer, system usability and limitations of the proposed AR system. We discuss \u2026",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing need to prepare young learners to be Artificial Intelligence (AI) capable for the future workforce and everyday life. Machine Learning (ML), as an integral subfield of AI, has become the new engine that revolutionizes practices of knowledge discovery. Making ML experience accessible to young learners, however, remains challenging due to its high demand for mathematical and computational skills. This research focuses on designing novel learning environments that help demystify ML technologies for K-12 students, and also investigating new opportunities for maximizing ML accessibility through integration with scientific discovery in STEM education. We developed SmileyCluster - a hands-on and collaborative learning environment that utilizes glyph-based data visualization and superposition comparative visualization to assist learning an entry-level ML technology, namely k-means \u2026",

    "abstract": "Lack of spontaneous pretend play is an early diagnostic indicator of autism spectrum conditions (ASC) along with impaired communication and social interaction. In a previous ISMAR poster [2] we proposed an Augmented Reality (AR) system to encourage pretend play, based on an analogy between imaginative interpretation of physical objects (pretense) and the superimposition of virtual content on the physical world in AR. This paper reports an empirical experiment evaluating that proposal, involving children between the ages of 4 and 7 who have been diagnosed with ASC. Results find significantly more pretend play, and higher engagement, using the AR system by comparison to a non-augmented condition. We also discuss usability issues and design implications for AR systems that aim to support children with ASC and other pervasive developmental disorders.",

In spite of the prevalence of small group learning in and outside of modern classrooms, little is known about the social nature of curiosity. In this paper, we present a model that predicts the temporal and social dynamics of curiosity based on sequences of behaviors exhibited by individuals engaged in group learning. This model reveals distinct sequential behavior patterns that predict increase and decrease of curiosity in individuals, and convergence to high and low curiosity among group members. In particular, convergence of the entire group to a state of high curiosity is highly correlated with sequences of behaviors that involve the most social of group behaviors - such as questions and answers, arguments and sharing findings, as well as scientific reasoning \u2026",

Since learning is often a social endeavor, social dynamics in collaborative learning may inevitably influence curiosity.

Recent research has shown that peer interaction may serve a special role in inducing curiosity through increased uncertainty and conceptual conflicts, since peers have similar authority in knowledge.

In this paper, we design and implement a virtual peer that can carry out key curiosity-eliciting science talk during a dialog-based multi-party board game.

And while many school systems increasingly undercut curiosity by teaching to the test, teachers are increasingly interested in how to evoke curiosity in their students to prepare them for a world in which lifelong learning and reskilling will be more and more important. One aspect of curiosity that has received little attention, however, is the role of peers in eliciting curiosity. We present what we believe to be the first theoretical framework that articulates an integrated socio-cognitive account of curiosity that ties observable behaviors in peers to underlying curiosity states. We make a bipartite distinction between individual and interpersonal functions that contribute to curiosity, and multimodal behaviors that fulfill these functions. We validate the proposed framework by leveraging a longitudinal latent variable modeling approach. Findings confirm a positive predictive relationship between the latent variables of individual and interpersonal functions and curiosity, with the interpersonal functions exercising a comparatively stronger influence. Prominent behavioral realizations of these functions are also discovered in a data-driven manner. We instantiate the proposed theoretical framework in a set of strategies and tactics that can be incorporated into learning technologies to indicate, evoke, and scaffold curiosity. This work is a step towards designing learning technologies that can recognize and evoke moment-by-moment curiosity during learning in social contexts and towards a more complete multimodal learning analytics.

    "abstract": "Pretend play is a symbolic activity in one's childhood which develops critical competences such as mental representation, linguistic expression and social knowledge. However, children with autism spectrum condition (ASC) are often found lacking in pretend play. Inspired by the analogy between pretend play and Augmented Reality (AR), both of which require dual representations of reality and its symbolic counterpart, we designed an AR system that aims to assist young children with ASC to be engaged in open-ended pretend play by overlaying suggested imaginary \"mental images\" over the physical environment. A usability study with normally developed children aged 4 to 5 was conducted to inform a future empirical study with autistic children.",

Recent advancements in deep learning bring promising results in AI commonsense reasoning. Nevertheless, a young child often has more sophisticated commonsense reasoning ability than state-of-the-art AI systems. This observation motivates us to investigate if AIs can learn from interacting with children in developing human-level commonsense reasoning capability. As a first step to launching this line of investigation, we develop a novel approach to generate contextualized multi-step commonsense reasoning paths for social situations conveyed via short stories. The resulting reasoning paths are intended to serve as an explainable media to enable laypersons to understand the underlying reasoning process behind AI predictions and provide feedback to help align AIs with human ways of thinking in commonsense reasoning.",

Little research, however, has examined the contextualized challenges of applying glyphs in K-12 ML-empowered scientific inquiry. Since teachers play a critical role at the frontier of technology integration for learning, as an initial attempt to address this research gap, we investigated the pattern recognition and interpretation behaviors of 18 K-12 STEM teachers when engaged in ML-empowered scientific inquiry during a professional development workshop. Findings confirm that teachers identified and interpreted ML-revealed patterns for scientific hypothesis formulation while it is challenging for novices to analyze and synthesize different patterns conceptually and extensively for more sophisticated inference.

Compared to conventional SAR techniques, the method we propose produces images with increased resolution, reduced sidelobes, reduced speckle and easier-to-segment regions. Our technique effectively deals with the complex-valued, random-phase nature of the underlying SAR reflectivities. An efficient and robust numerical solution is achieved through extensions of half-quadratic regularization methods to the complex-valued SAR problem.

Based on the observation that typical underlying scenes usually exhibit sparsity in terms of such features, this paper presents an image formation method that formulates the SAR imaging problem as a sparse signal representation problem. For problems of complex-valued nature, such as SAR, a key challenge is how to choose the dictionary and the representation scheme for effective sparse representation. Since features of the SAR reflectivity magnitude are usually of interest, the approach is designed to sparsely represent the magnitude of the complex-valued scattered field.

    "abstract": "In this paper we present an algorithm for wide-angle synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image formation. Reconstruction of wide-angle SAR holds a promise of higher resolution and better information about a scene, but it also poses a number of challenges when compared to the traditional narrow-angle SAR. Most prominently, the isotropic point scattering model is no longer valid. We present an algorithm capable of producing high resolution reflectivity maps in both space and aspect, thus accounting for the anisotropic scattering behavior of targets. We pose the problem as a non-parametric three-dimensional inversion problem, with two constraints: magnitudes of the backscattered power are highly correlated across closely spaced look angles and the backscattered power originates from a small set of point scatterers. This approach considers jointly all scatterers in the scene across all azimuths, and exploits the \u2026",

Two hundred sixteen chicks were divided into four groups: control (no antibiotic or thyme extracts (I), flavomycin (II), thyme oil extract (III) and thyme water extract (IV). Groups II and III received 1 g/kg flavomycin as an antibiotic and 2.5 ml/kg thyme oil extract, respectively. Birds in group IV received 100 ml/l of thyme water extract in their drinking water. There were no significant differences in liveweight between the treatment groups, but feed intake differed (P< 0.01) at 0-5 weeks of age. Results showed that thyme extracts decreased feed consumption during the experiment. Similarly, the survival rate differed significantly (P< 0.01) between groups; the lowest was in antibiotic group. The levels of plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, high density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein and alkaline phosphates were similar in the four treatments. The highest rate of total oxidant status and total antioxidant response were found in group III, the lowest rate of DNA damage in the thyme oil (III) and thyme water extracts (IV) groups. It was concluded that supplementing thyme extract products in the diet of quails at the doses studied does not lead to a negative effect on the growth performance of the birds.

Hence efficient, distributed solutions are needed. We propose techniques based on graphical models to efficiently solve such data association problems in sensor networks. Our approach scales well with the number of sensor nodes in the network, and it is well--suited for distributed implementation. Distributed inference is realized by a message--passing algorithm which requires iterative, parallel exchange of information among neighboring nodes on the graph. So as to address trade--offs between inference performance and communication costs, we also propose a communication--sensitive form of message--passing that is capable of achieving near--optimal performance using far less communication.

    "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges for automatic target recognition (ATR) methods is the accurate and efficient extraction of features from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. We have recently developed a new SAR image formation technique which is recognition-oriented in the sense that it enhances features in the scene which we believe are important for recognition purposes. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the images produced by this technique in terms of preserving and enhancing these features. The findings of our analysis indicate that the new SAR image formation method provides images with higher resolution of scatterers, and better separability of different regions as compared to conventional SAR images.",

    "abstract": "The reconstruction of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from phase history data is an ill-posed inverse problem which, in several lines of recent work, is solved by minimizing a cost function. Existing reconstruction methods use regularization to tackle the ill-posed nature of the imaging task. However, in general, these regularizers are either too simple to capture complex spatial patterns and can only promote fixed, predefined features, or lead to non-quadratic cost functions that are nontrivial to minimize. Recently emerging plug-and-play (PnP) priors technique is a flexible framework that allows forward models of imaging systems to be integrated with state-of-the-art regularizers. Inspired by this, we propose a novel PnP SAR image reconstruction framework for spotlight-mode SAR.

Such algorithms assume that the mathematical model of the imaging system is perfectly known. However, in practice, it is very common to encounter various types of model errors.

We propose a nonquadratic regularization-based framework for joint image formation and model error correction.

Recently, retail product recognition has become an interesting computer vision research topic. We focus on the classification of products on shelves in a store. This is a very challenging classification problem because many product classes are visually similar in terms of shape, color, texture, and metric size. In shelves, same or similar products are more likely to appear adjacent to each other and displayed in certain arrangements rather than at random. The arrangement of the products on the shelves has a spatial continuity both in brand and metric size. By using this context information, the co-occurrence of the products and the adjacency relations between the products can be statistically modeled.

Results show that the neural network approach is an attractive and effective way of extracting land cover information using multi-spectral, multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite images.

    "abstract": "Graph signal processing (GSP) is a key tool for satisfying the growing demand for information processing over networks. However, the success of GSP in downstream learning and inference tasks such as supervised classification is heavily dependent on the prior identification of the relational structures. Graphs are natural descriptors of the relationships between entities of complex environments. The underlying graph is not readily detectable in many cases and one has to infer the topology from the observed signals which admit certain regularity over the sought representation. Assuming that signals are smooth over the latent class-specific graph is the notion we build upon. Firstly, we address the problem of graph signal classification by proposing a novel framework for discriminative graph learning. To learn discriminative graphs, we invoke the assumption that signals belonging to each class are smooth with \u2026",

We solve the challenging optimization problems posed in our framework by a novel extension of half-quadratic regularization methods. We present experimental results from three coherent imaging applications: digital holography, synthetic aperture radar, and medical ultrasound.

Existing techniques in the literature estimate the underlying shape distribution by extending Parzen density estimator to the space of shapes.

Just like many common SAR imaging methods, these techniques also assume the targets in the scene are stationary over the data collection interval. Here, we consider the problem of imaging in the presence of targets with unknown motion in the scene. Moving targets cause phase errors in the SAR data and these errors lead to defocusing in the corresponding spatial region in the reconstructed image.

    "abstract": "Segmenting images of low quality or with missing data is a challenging problem. Integrating statistical prior information about the shapes to be segmented can improve the segmentation results significantly. Most shape-based segmentation algorithms optimize an energy functional and find a point estimate for the object to be segmented. This does not provide a measure of the degree of confidence in that result, neither does it provide a picture of other probable solutions based on the data and the priors. With a statistical view, addressing these issues would involve the problem of characterizing the posterior densities of the shapes of the objects to be segmented. For such characterization, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling-based image segmentation algorithm that uses statistical shape priors. In addition to better characterization of the statistical structure of the problem, such an approach would also have the potential to address issues with getting stuck at local optima, suffered by existing shape-based segmentation methods. Our approach is able to characterize the posterior probability density in the space of shapes through its samples, and to return multiple solutions, potentially from different modes of a multimodal probability density, which would be encountered, eg, in segmenting objects from multiple shape classes. We present promising results on a variety of data sets. We also provide an extension for segmenting shapes of objects with parts that can go through independent shape variations. This extension involves the use of local shape priors on object parts and provides robustness to limitations in shape training \u2026",

    "abstract": "Existing physical model-based imaging methods for ultrasound elasticity reconstruction utilize fixed variational regularizers that may not be appropriate for the application of interest or may not capture complex spatial prior information about the underlying tissues. On the other hand, end-to-end learning-based methods count solely on the training data, not taking advantage of the governing physical laws of the imaging system. Integrating learning-based priors with physical forward models for ultrasound elasticity imaging, we present a joint reconstruction framework which guarantees that learning driven reconstructions are consistent with the underlying physics. For solving the elasticity inverse problem as a regularized optimization problem, we propose a plug-and-play (PnP) reconstruction approach in which each iteration of the elasticity image estimation process involves separate updates incorporating data fidelity \u2026",

The DNSM is formed by the disjunction of polytopes, which themselves are formed by the conjunctions of half-spaces. The DNSM's parametric nature allows the use of powerful local prior statistics, and its implicit nature removes the need to use landmarks and easily handles topological changes.

We develop an image formation technique that simultaneously enhances multiple types of features by posing the problem as one of sparse signal representation based on overcomplete dictionaries. Due to the complex-valued nature of the reflectivities in SAR, our new approach is designed to sparsely represent the magnitude of the complex-valued scattered field in terms of multiple features, which turns the image reconstruction problem into a joint optimization problem over the representation of the magnitude and the phase of the underlying field reflectivities.

    "abstract": "The reconstruction of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from phase history data is an ill-posed inverse problem. Existing reconstruction methods use regularization to tackle the ill-posed nature of the imaging task, while assuming a forward model or trying to learn one. In either case, these methods do not decouple the sensing model and the priors used as regularizers. Recently emerging plug-and-play (PnP) priors is a flexible framework that allows forward models of imaging systems to be matched with the state-of-the-art prior models. Inspired by this, in this work, we propose a novel PnP SAR reconstruction framework. This framework decouples the forward model and the prior model, therefore allows us to replace either of them without affecting the other. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) based prior model for the reconstruction of synthetic SAR scenes and \u2026",

Unlike existing methods where motion is limited to first- or second-order phase terms, we take into account realistic motion of a maneuvering target that can involve a third-order phase term corresponding to the rate of rotational acceleration. In addition, unlike existing fixed dictionary-based methods, which require designing a large dictionary that needs to take into account all of the possible motion parameters, we propose a modified OMP reconstruction method that requires a dictionary only based on the first-order phase term and estimates the second- and third-order phase terms using an optimization algorithm. Simulation examples and comparison with existing methods show the viability of our approach for imaging moving targets consisting of higher order motion.",

    "abstract": "Statistical characterization of morphological changes of dendritic spines is becoming of crucial interest in the field of neurobiology. Automatic detection and segmentation of dendritic spines promises significant reductions on the time spent by the scientists and reduces the subjectivity concerns. In this paper, we present two approaches for automated detection of dendritic spines in 2-photon laser scanning microscopy (2pLSM) images. The first method combines the idea of dot enhancement filters with information from the dendritic skeleton. The second method learns an SVM classifier by utilizing some pre-labeled SIFT feature descriptors and uses the classifier to detect dendritic spines in new images. For the segmentation of detected spines, we employ a watershed-variational segmentation algorithm. We evaluate the proposed approaches by comparing with manual segmentations of domain experts and the results \u2026",

    "abstract": "Integration of shape prior information into level set formulations has led to great improvements in image segmentation in the presence of missing information, occlusion, and noise. However, most shape-based segmentation techniques incorporate image intensity through simplistic data terms. A common underlying assumption of such data terms is that the foreground and the background regions in the image are homogeneous, i.e., intensities are piecewise constant or piecewise smooth. This situation makes integration of shape priors inefficient in the presence of intensity inhomogeneities. In this paper, we propose a new approach for combining information from shape priors with that from image intensities. More specifically, our approach uses shape priors learned by nonparametric density estimation and incorporates image intensity distributions learned in a supervised manner. Such a combination has \u2026",

We observe that it is possible to classify tasks of varying difficulty based on EEG signals. Additionally, we also present a correlation analysis between intention levels detected from EEG and surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals.

    "abstract": "Automatic target detection (ATD) methods for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery are sensitive to image resolution, target size, clutter complexity, and speckle noise level. However, a robust ATD method needs to be less sensitive to the above factors. In this study, a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) based method is proposed which can perform target detection independent of image resolution and target size even in heterogeneous background clutter. The proposed method is computationally efficient since clutter statistics are calculated only for candidate target regions and a single execution of the method is sufficient for different types of targets having different shapes and sizes. Computational efficiency is further increased by parallelizing the algorithm using OpenMP and NVidia CUDA implementations.",

    "abstract": "We consider sparse image reconstruction methods for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and discuss how issues related to the phase of the complex-valued SAR reflectivities and the phase of the observed SAR data emerge and are handled in a number of currently available methods. In particular, we consider analysis and synthesis models for sparsity-driven SAR imaging, and discuss how the optimization problems in both cases need to treat the magnitudes and the phases of the reflectivities separately. Then, we consider errors in the SAR observation model, due to, e.g., imperfect knowledge of the SAR sensing platform. Such errors lead to phase errors in the SAR data and cause defocusing of the formed imagery. We describe how joint imaging and phase error correction can be performed in a sparsity-driven imaging framework. Finally, we consider the problem of SAR imaging in the presence of moving targets in \u2026",

Based on this perspective, we formulate the problem of SAR imaging of motion-containing scenes as one of joint imaging and phase error compensation. The proposed method is based on the minimization of a cost function which involves sparsity-imposing regularization terms on the reflectivity field to be imaged, considering that it admits a sparse representation as well as on the spatial structure of the motion-related phase errors, reflecting the assumption that only a small percentage of the entire scene contains moving objects. To incorporate the spatial structure of the phase errors into the problem, we provide three different sparsity-enforcing prior terms.

Proposed algorithm can be applied broadly to scenes that exhibit sparsity with respect to any dictionary. This is done by extending our previously developed sparse representation-based SAR imaging framework to joint SAR image formation and autofocus.

Due to the lack of reliable and fully automatic tools to analyze the morphology of the spines, such analysis is often performed manually, which is a laborious and time intensive task and prone to subjectivity. In this paper we present an automated approach to extract features using basic image processing techniques, and classify spines into mushroom or stubby by applying machine learning algorithms.

The structure of a dendritic spine correlates with its functional efficacy. Learning and memory studies have shown that a great deal of the information stored by a neuron is contained in the synapses. High precision tracking of synaptic structures can give hints about the dynamic nature of memory and help us understand how memories evolve both in biological and artificial neural networks.

To solve the resulting optimization problems, we propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), an augmented Lagrangian method, for compressive SAR image reconstruction.

In this work, we propose the novel spatio-temporal attention neural network (STANN) to extract discriminative spatial and temporal features of EEG signals by a parallel structure of multi-column convolutional neural network and attention-based bidirectional long-short term memory.

However, adaptation to increasingly dynamic environments as well as demands for real-time processing of streaming data pose major challenges to this end. In this context, we develop novel algorithms for online network topology inference given streaming observations assumed to be smooth on the sought graph. Unlike existing batch algorithms, our goal is to track the (possibly) time-varying network topology while maintaining the memory and computational costs in check by processing graph signals sequentially-in-time. To recover the graph in an online fashion, we leverage proximal gradient (PG) methods to solve a judicious smoothness-regularized, time-varying optimization problem.

As most existing quasi-static elastography methods count on deterministic formulations of the forward model resulting in a constrained optimization problem, the impact of displacement observation errors has not been well addressed. To this end, we propose a new statistical technique that leads to a unified optimization problem for elasticity imaging. Our statistical model takes the imperfect nature of the displacement measurements into account, and leads to an observation model for the Young\u2019s modulus that involves signal dependent colored noise. To solve the resulting regularized optimization problem, we propose a fixed-point algorithm that leverages proximal splitting methods.

The traditional approach of sending compressed images to a central node has certain disadvantages such as decreasing the performance of further processing (i.e., tracking) because of low quality images. Instead, we propose a feature compression-based decentralized tracking framework that is better matched with the further inference goal of tracking. In our method, each camera performs feature extraction and obtains likelihood functions. By transforming to an appropriate domain and taking only the significant coefficients, these likelihood functions are compressed and this new \u2026",

We evaluate the performance of FPD through its impact on the performance of railway detection. To this end, we propose a semi-automated algorithm for railway detection in SAR images.

    "abstract": "In synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, the presence of moving targets in the scene causes phase errors in the SAR data and subsequently defocusing in the formed image. The defocusing caused by the moving targets exhibits space-variant characteristics, i.e., the defocusing arises only in the parts of the image containing the moving targets, whereas the stationary background is not defocused. Considering that the reflectivity field to be imaged usually admits sparse representation, we propose a sparsity-driven method for joint SAR imaging and removing the defocus caused by moving targets. The method is performed in a nonquadratic regularization based framework by solving an optimization problem, in which prior information about both the scene and phase errors are incorporated as constraints.",

ZEB2-dependent ABCG2 gene expression and the effects of resveratrol on proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis were explored in SNU398 cell clones. An inverse correlation between ZEB1/ZEB2 and ABCG2 levels were observed both in CSCs and in ZEB2-knockdown cells.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for dendritic spine detection in time series. The proposed approach initially performs spine detection at each time point and improves the accuracy by exploiting the information obtained from tracking of individual spines over time. To detect dendritic spines in a time point image we employ an SVM classifier trained by pre-labeled SIFT feature descriptors in combination with a dot enhancement filter. Second, to track the growth or loss of spines, we apply a SIFT-based rigid registration method for the alignment of time-series images. This step takes into account both the structure and the movement of objects, combined with a robust dynamic \u2026",

However, in principle, image formation does not provide any new information regarding the classification task and it may even cause some information loss. Motivated by this, in this paper, we examine two SAR ATR frameworks that work in the phase history domain. In the first framework, we feed the complex-valued phase histories to a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) directly, and in the second one, we perform image formation, phase removal, and phase history generation before feeding the data to the CNN. CNNs are known for their superior performance on image classification tasks. The effectiveness of CNNs is based on dependency patterns in a given input. Thus, the input of CNNs is not limited to images but any input \u2026",

    "abstract": "Functional properties of neurons are strongly coupled with their morphology. Changes in neuronal activity alter morphological characteristics of dendritic spines. First step towards understanding the structure-function relationship is to group spines into main spine classes reported in the literature. Shape analysis of dendritic spines can help neuroscientists understand the underlying relationships. Due to unavailability of reliable automated tools, this analysis is currently performed manually which is a time-intensive and subjective task. Several studies on spine shape classification have been reported in the literature, however, there is an on-going debate on whether distinct spine shape classes exist or whether spines should be modeled through a continuum of shape variations. Another challenge is the subjectivity and bias that is introduced due to the supervised nature of classification approaches. In this \u2026",

MSERs of each scale space image are found and then combined through a decision level fusion strategy, namely \u201cselective scale fusion\u201d (SSF), where contrast and boundary curvature of each MSER are considered.

Considering the lack of a publicly available database with affective ratings of contemporary verbal stimuli obtained from native Turkish speakers, we present the affective norms for two datasets of Turkish words carefully adapted from the Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW) database. The valence and arousal ratings are obtained from 61 college-aged participants for 127 highly arousing, emotionally-loaded words in the Adapted Turkish Affective List (ATAL). The ATAL ratings show a tendency of classifying fewer words as positive compared to the original list of stimuli, significantly higher arousal levels for positively rated Turkish stimuli compared to the negative and neutral words, and more \u2026",

    "abstract": "As the first step of automatic image interpretation systems, automatic detection of targets should be accurate and fast. For Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) is the most popular framework used for target detection. In CFAR, modeling of the clutter is crucial since the decision threshold is calculated based on this model. In this study, we propose to model the background statistics using a Rayleigh Mixture (RM) model. Such an approach facilitates modeling of complex statistics, including but not limited to those involved in heavy tailed distributions, which are shown to be good fits especially for high resolution SAR images. We also propose an efficient method to evaluate CFAR thresholds according to the proposed model by use of Summed Area Tables (SAT). SAT provides a remarkable efficiency as the Rayleigh distribution is represented by only one parameter that can be \u2026",

Our system consists of three important components:(i) a nested hierarchy of product classes are automatically constructed based on visual similarities,(ii) a confidence set predictor is trained based on class posteriors by using coarse-to-fine binary classifiers to discriminate each nested cluster of the hierarchy from the remainder of classes and a Bayesian network (BN) model that encodes the joint distribution of classifier scores with the fine-level class variable, and (iii) an hidden Markov model (HMM) is trained with nested hidden states from the class hierarchy to model spatial transition across the nodes of product class hierarchy and resolve errors in the context-free confidence set results. Novel aspects of the proposed method include (i) combining confidence sets and context information via a HMM,(ii) applying this concept to fine grained recognition of products arranged in retail shelves, and (iii) presenting experimental results on four large datasets, collected from actual retail stores.

    "abstract": "Analysis of dendritic spines is an essential task to understand the functional behavior of neurons. Their shape variations are known to be closely linked with neuronal activities. Spine shape analysis in particular, can assist neuroscientists to identify this relationship. A novel shape representation has been proposed recently, called Disjunctive Normal Shape Models (DNSM). DNSM is a parametric shape representation and has proven to be successful in several segmentation problems. In this paper, we apply this parametric shape representation as a feature extraction algorithm. Further, we propose a kernel density estimation (KDE) based classification approach for dendritic spine classification. We evaluate our proposed approach on a data set of 242 spines, and observe that it outperforms the classical morphological feature based approach for spine classification.

This research focuses on effects of alertness on the performance of motor imagery (MI) BCI as a common mental control paradigm.

Such systems find applications in rehabilitation, as an alternative communication channel and in multimedia applications for entertainment and gaming. In this work, a new approach based on the Time-Frequency (TF) distribution of the signal power, obtained by autoregressive methods and the use Hidden Markov models (HMM) is developed. This approach take into account the changes of power on different frequency bands with time. For that purpose HMM\u2019s are used to modeling the changes in the power during the execution of two different motor tasks. The use of TF methods involves a problem related to the selection of the frequency bands that can lead to over fitting (due to the course of dimensionality) as well as problems related to the selection of the model parameters. These problems are solved in this work by combining two methods for feature selection: Fisher Score and Sequential Floating Forward Selection. The results are compared to the three top results of the BCI competition IV. It is shown here that the proposed method over perform those other methods in four subjects and the average over all the subjects equals the one obtained by the winner algorithm of the competition.",

One goal in passive radar imaging is to form images of aircraft using signals transmitted by commercial radio and television stations, which then get reflected from the objects of interest. This involves reconstructing an image from sparse samples of its Fourier transform. Due to the sparse nature of the aperture, a conventional image formation approach based on direct Fourier transformation results in quite dramatic artifacts in the image, as compared to the case of active SAR imaging. The region-enhanced image formation method we consider appears to significantly reduce such artifacts, and preserve the features of the imaged object. Furthermore, this approach exhibits robustness to measurement noise. We demonstrate our results using data \u2026",

Existing methods mostly use large amounts of EEG data of each new subject to calibrate the algorithm, which could be time-consuming and not user-oriented. To address this issue, we propose a combination of using transformers (TF) and adversarial discriminative domain adaptation (ADDA) to perform the emotion recognition task in a cross-subject manner. TF principally relies on the attention mechanism. Our proposed approach performs scaledot product attention on the feature-channel aspect of EEG data to improve the spatial features. Then, the temporal transforming is applied to get the global discriminative representations from the time component.

The DNLS is formed by union of polytopes which themselves are formed by intersections of half-spaces. The proposed level set framework has the following major advantages compared to other level set methods available in the literature. First, segmentation using DNLS converges much faster. Second, the DNLS level set function remains regular throughout its evolution. Third, the proposed multiphase version of the DNLS is less sensitive to initialization, and its computational cost and memory requirement remains almost constant as the number of objects to be simultaneously segmented grows \u2026",

Thanks to the empirical success of convolutional neural network (CNN) denoisers, numerous Plug-and-Play algorithms utilizing CNN denoisers have been proposed to solve various image recovery tasks. Unfortunately, those Plug-and-Play algorithms lack representing the uncertainty on the parameters of CNN denoisers because their training procedure yields only a point estimate for the parameters of the CNN denoiser. In this paper, we present a novel Plug-and-Play model that quantifies the uncertainty on the parameters of the CNN denoiser. The proposed model places a probability distribution on the parameters of the CNN denoiser and carries out approximate Bayesian inference to obtain the posterior distribution of the parameters to characterize their uncertainty. The uncertainty information provided by the proposed Plug-and-Play model allows characterizing how certain the model is for a given input. The proposed Plug-and-Play model is applicable to a broad set of computational imaging problems, with the requirement that the data fidelity term is differentiable, and has a simple implementation in deep learning frameworks. We evaluate the proposed Plug-and-Play model on a magnetic resonance imaging reconstruction problem and demonstrate its uncertainty characterization capability.",

In such scenarios, exploiting statistical prior information about the shapes to be segmented can improve the segmentation results significantly. Incorporating prior density of shapes into a Bayesian framework leads to the posterior density of segmenting shapes given the observed data. Most segmentation algorithms that exploit shape priors optimize a cost function based on the posterior density and find a point estimate (e.g., using maximum a posteriori estimation). However, especially when the prior shape density is multimodal leading to a multimodal posterior density, a point estimate does not provide a measure of the degree of confidence in that result, neither does it provide a picture of other probable solutions based on the observed data and the shape priors.

Many BCI systems make use of the phenomena of event-related synchronization and de-synchronization of brain waves as a main feature for classification of different cognitive tasks. However, the temporal dynamics of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals contain additional information that can be incorporated into the inference engine in order to improve the performance of the BCIs. This information about the dynamics of the signals have been exploited previously in BCIs by means of generative and discriminative methods. In particular, hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been used in previous works. These methods have the disadvantage that the model parameters such as the number of hidden states and the number of Gaussian mixtures need to be fix \"a priori\". In this work, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric model for brain signal classification that does not require \"a priori\" selection of the number of hidden states and the number of Gaussian mixtures of a HMM. The results show that the proposed model outperform other methods based on HMM as well as the winner algorithm of the BCI competition IV.",

    "abstract": "Various neuroimaging studies aim to understand the complex nature of human motor behavior. There exists a variety of experimental approaches to study neurophysiological correlates of performance during different motor tasks. As distinct from studies based on visuomotor learning, we investigate changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during an actual physical motor adaptation learning experiment. Based on statistical analysis of EEG signals collected during a force-field adaptation task performed with the dominant hand, we observe a modulation of pre-movement upper alpha (10-12 Hz) and lower beta (13-16 Hz) powers over the contralateral region. This modulation is observed to be stronger in lower beta range and, through a regression analysis, is shown to be related with motor adaptation performance on a subject-specific level.",

Existing techniques in the literature estimate the underlying shape distribution by extending Parzen density estimator to the space of shapes. Such density estimates are only expressed in terms of distances between shapes which may not be sufficient for ensuring accurate segmentation when the observed intensities provide very little information about the object boundaries. In such scenarios, employing additional shape-dependent discriminative features as priors and exploiting both shape and feature priors can aid to the segmentation process. In this paper, we propose a segmentation algorithm that uses nonparametric joint shape and feature priors using Parzen density estimator.

The a posteriori distribution of each target location is constructed through a message passing algorithm on the factor graph representation of the joint posterior which is based on the loopy sum product algorithm. After constructing the posteriors, it is possible to compute the MAP or MMSE estimation expressions of the target locations under these distributions. This approach is the application of an information architecture for distributed inference proposed before. Therefore it is naturally amenable to a distributed implementation and depending on functions which can be easily generated, it has the advantage of compliance with the requirements of sensor networks.",

Improved constraints on the detectability and properties of mantle discontinuities can be obtained with P-to-S receiver function (Ps-RF) where energy scatters from P to S as seismic waves propagate across discontinuities of interest. However, due to the interference of crustal multiples, uppermost mantle discontinuities are more commonly imaged with lower resolution S-to-P receiver function (Sp-RF).

In this work, we propose a quick-to-adopt framework that can transform a given generative model-based posterior sampling method into a statistical model that can quantify the generative model uncertainty. The proposed framework is built upon the principles of Bayesian neural networks with latent variables and uses ensembling to capture the uncertainty on the parameters of a generative model. We evaluate the proposed framework on the computed tomography reconstruction problem and demonstrate its capability to quantify generative model uncertainty with an illustrative example. We also show that the proposed method can improve the quality of the reconstructions and the predictive uncertainty estimates of the generative model-based posterior sampling method used within the proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "High-content imaging techniques in conjunction with in vitro microphysiological systems (MPS) allow for novel explorations of physiological phenomena with a high degree of translational relevance due to the usage of human cell lines. MPS featuring ultrathin and nanoporous silicon nitride membranes (\u00b5SiM) have been utilized in the past to facilitate high magnification phase contrast microscopy recordings of leukocyte trafficking events in a living mimetic of the human vascular microenvironment. Notably, the imaging plane can be set directly at the endothelial interface in a \u00b5SiM device, resulting in a high-resolution capture of an endothelial cell (EC) and leukocyte coculture reacting to different stimulatory conditions. The abundance of data generated from recording observations at this interface can be used to elucidate disease mechanisms related to vascular barrier dysfunction, such as sepsis. The appearance of leukocytes in these recordings is dynamic, changing in character, location and time. Consequently, conventional image processing techniques are incapable of extracting the spatiotemporal profiles and bulk statistics of numerous leukocytes responding to a disease state, necessitating labor-intensive manual processing, a significant limitation of this approach. Here we describe a machine learning pipeline that uses a semantic segmentation algorithm and classification script that, in combination, is capable of automated and label-free leukocyte trafficking analysis in a coculture mimetic. The developed computational toolset has demonstrable parity with manually tabulated datasets when characterizing leukocyte spatiotemporal behavior \u2026",

    "abstract": "Motor imagery (MI) classification based on electroencephalogram (EEG) is a widely-used technique in non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Since EEG recordings suffer from heterogeneity across subjects and labeled data insufficiency, designing a classifier that performs the MI independently from the subject with limited labeled samples would be desirable. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel subject-independent semi-supervised deep architecture (SSDA). The proposed SSDA consists of two parts: an unsupervised and a supervised element. The training set contains both labeled and unlabeled data samples from multiple subjects. First, the unsupervised part, known as the columnar spatiotemporal auto-encoder (CST-AE), extracts latent features from all the training samples by maximizing the similarity between the original and reconstructed data. A dimensional scaling approach is \u2026",

The structure of a dendritic spine positively correlates with its functional efficacy. Learning and memory studies have shown that great deal of the information stored by a neuron is contained in the synapses. High precision tracking of synaptic structures can give hints about the dynamic nature of memory and help us to understand how memories evolve both in biological and artificial neural networks. Experiments that aim to investigate the dynamics behind the structural changes of dendritic spines require the collection and analysis of large time-series datasets. In this paper, we present an open-source software called SpineS for the automatic longitudinal structural analysis of dendritic spines with additional features for manual intervention to ensure optimal analysis. Our extensive experimental analyses on multiple datasets demonstrate that SpineS can achieve a high-level performance on samples collected both by two-photon and confocal imaging systems.",

When purely data driven segmentation produces poor results, the final segmentation is generally affected adversely. One challenge faced by many existing data terms is due to the fact that they consider only pixel intensities to decide whether to assign a pixel to the foreground or to the background region. When the distributions of the foreground and back-ground pixel intensities have significant overlap, such data terms become ineffective, as they produce uncertain results for many pixels in a test image. In such cases, using prior information about the spatial context of the object to be segmented together with the data term can bring a curve to a plausible stage \u2026",

    "abstract": "Segmenting images with low-quality, low signal to noise ratio has been a challenging task in computer vision. It has been shown that statistical prior information about the shape of the object to be segmented can be used to significantly mitigate this problem. However estimating the probability densities of the object shapes in the space of shapes can be difficult. This problem becomes more difficult when there is limited amount of training data or the testing images contain missing data. Most shape model based segmentation approaches tend to minimize an energy functional to segment the object. In this paper we propose a shape-based segmentation algorithm that utilizes convolutional neural networks to learn a posterior distribution of disjunction of conjunctions of half spaces to segment the object. This approach shows promising results on noisy and occluded data where it is able to accurately segment the objects. We show visual and quantitative results on datasets from several applications, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We should also note that inference with a CNN is computationally more efficient than density estimation and sampling approaches.",

The traditional approach of sending compressed images to a central node has certain disadvantages such as decreasing the performance of further processing (i.e., tracking) because of low quality images.

Another common problem in BCI systems is the situation where the labeled data are scarce. In this study, we take a semi-supervised learning perspective and propose solving both types of problems by updating the BCI system with labels obtained from the outputs of the classifier. To test the approach, data from motor imagery BCI system are used. Attributes extracted from EEG signals are classified with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). With respect to the static classifiers, accuracy was improved approximately 4% using the proposed adaptation approach in the case of a training dataset. Even though the difference between the performance of static and adaptive classifiers decreases as the size of training data increases, the accuracy of our proposed adaptive classifier remains higher. The proposed approach has also improved the performance of a BCI system around 4% in the case of non-stationary signals as well.",

However, moving targets in the scene cause space-variant defocusing, i.e., the defocusing arises only in the parts of the image including the moving targets, whereas the stationary background is not defocused. To obtain a focused image, phase errors caused by the moving objects need to be removed.

    "abstract": "In this paper, some of the factors that affect classification performance of EEG based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) is studied. Study is specified on P300 speller system which is also an EEG based BCI system. P300 is a physiological signal that represents a response of brain to a given stimulus which occurs right 300 ms after the stimulus onset. When this signal occurs, it changes the continuous EEG some micro volts. Since this is not a very distinguished change, some other physiological signals (movement of muscles and heart, blinking or other neural activities) may distort this signal. In order to understand if there is really a P300 component in the signal, consecutive P300 epochs are averaged over trials. In this study, we have been tried two different multi channel data handling methods with two different frequency windows. Resulted data have been classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Classical methods for magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) try to solve a regularized optimization problem comprising a deterministic physical model and a prior constraint as data-fidelity term and regularization term, respectively. For improving the elasticity reconstructions, appropriate prior about the underlying elasticity distribution is required which is not unique. This article proposes an infused approach for MRE reconstruction by integrating the statistical representation of the physical laws of harmonic motions and learning-based prior. For data-fidelity term, we use a statistical linear-algebraic model of equilibrium equations and for the regularizer, data-driven regularization by denoising (RED) is utilized.

The method is verified with numerical simulations, but there is no restriction on adapting this into an optical experiment. In the simulations, a computer-generated hologram is first sampled with random binary patterns, and measurements are utilized in a recovery algorithm to form a compressive hologram. The compressive hologram is then divided into two parts (two apertures), and these parts are separately reconstructed to form a stereo image pair. The pair is eventually utilized in stereo disparity method for depth map extraction. The depth maps of the compressive holograms with the sampling rates of 2, 25, and 50 percent are compared with the depth map extracted from the original hologram, on which compressed sensing is not applied. It is demonstrated that the depth profiles obtained from the compressive holograms are in very good agreement with the depth profile obtained from the original hologram despite the data reduction.",

The bright pixels which constitute curvilinear features in SAR images are usually disrupted and also degraded by high amount of speckle noise which makes extraction of such curvilinear features very difficult. In this paper an approach for the extraction of curvilinear features from SAR images is presented. The proposed approach is based on searching the curvilinear features as an optimum unidirectional path crossing over the vertices of the features determined after a despeckling operation.

The problem is even more challenging in the context of sensor networks, since association is coupled across the network, yet centralized processing is in general infeasible due to power and bandwidth limitations. Hence efficient, distributed solutions are needed. We propose techniques based on graphical models to efficiently solve such data association problems in sensor networks. Our approach takes advantage of the sparsity inherent in the problem structure resulting from the fact that each target can be observed by only a small number of sensors and makes use of efficient message-passing algorithms for graphical models to infer the maximum a posteriori (MAP) association configuration. We illustrate our approach for several typical scenarios in multi-target tracking. Our approach scales well \u2026",

    "title": "Plug-and-Play ADMM Based Radar Range Profile Reconstruction Using Deep Priors.",
    "abstract": "Reconstructing a range profile from radar returns, which are both noisy and band-limited, presents a challenging and ill-posed inverse problem. Conventional reconstruction methods often involve employing matched filters in pulsed radars or performing a Fourier transform of the received signal in continuous wave radars. However, both of these approaches rely on specific models and model-based inversion techniques that may not fully leverage prior knowledge of the range profiles being reconstructed when such information is accessible. To incorporate prior distribution information of the range profile data into the reconstruction process, regularizers can be employed to encourage specific spatial patterns within the range profiles. Nevertheless, these regularizers often fall short in effectively capturing the intricate spatial correlations within the range profile data, or they may not readily allow for analytical minimization of the cost function. Recently, Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework has emerged as a means to provide a way of decoupling the model inversion from the regularization of the priors, enabling the incorporation of any desired regularizer into the inversion process in a plug-and-play (PnP) fashion. In this paper, we implement an ADMM framework to address the radar range profile reconstruction problem where we propose to employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a regularization method for enhancing the quality of the inversion process which usually suffers from the ill-posed nature of the problem. We demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning networks as a regularization method within the ADMM \u2026",

Although deep learning approaches exhibit strong performance, they often suffer from vulnerabilities to various perturbations, like environmental noise and adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose an Inception feature generator and two-sided perturbation (INC-TSP) approach to enhance emotion recognition in brain-computer interfaces. INC-TSP integrates the Inception module for EEG data analysis and employs two-sided perturbation (TSP) as a defensive mechanism against input perturbations. TSP introduces worst-case perturbations to the model's weights and inputs, reinforcing the model's elasticity against adversarial attacks. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of maintaining accurate emotion recognition in the presence of input uncertainties. We validate INC-TSP in a subject-independent three-class emotion recognition scenario, demonstrating robust performance.",

    "title": "Seeing into the Mantle by Sifting through Echoes, Reverbs & Noise",
    "abstract": "Our planet's mantle is the largest rock-layer by volume. Within and across its three layers seismological evidence suggests new discontinuities requiring explanations that are still debated. In the upper and lower mantle (~ 150, 250, 1,000 km), spatially variable positive gradients are observed. Across the mantle transition zone (~ 330 and 700 km) negative velocity gradients are observed. To explain these observations melting anomalies and compositional heterogeneities have been proposed. To evaluate these, and other ideas, it is crucial to improve our threshold for detecting mantle discontinuities especially in noisy environments. Here, we address the limitations of current observational techniques especially in sparsely instrumented regions and above highly reverberant layers. We describe two new techniques: CRISP-RF (Clean Receiver function Imaging with Sparse Radon Filters) and FADER (Fast Automated \u2026",

    "title": "Crystalline lens geometry from a clinical OCT-based biometer as a function of age and refraction",
    "abstract": "Purpose: Determining the structural changes of the human crystalline lens with age and refraction is important in the management of cataracts. We performed a retrospective analysis of anterior segment Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images to assess the relationship between crystalline lens geometry, age, and preoperative refraction.Methods: Preoperative OCT images from the IOLMaster700 (Zeiss, swept source-OCT, six radial images per measurement) were obtained in 41 eyes from 21 subjects undergoing cataract surgery at a single institution. Surface segmentation and distortion correction with custom-developed algorithms were performed to obtain preoperative 3-D models of the eye and the following parameters: radius of curvature of the anterior lens surface (RAL), radius of curvature of the posterior lens surface (RPL), lens thickness (LT), and pupil diameter. A manifest refraction in spherical equivalent (SE) was obtained preoperatively. Eyes were separated into three age groups (ages\u2264 65 years (n= 18),> 65 to\u2264 72 years (n= 12), and> 72 years (n= 11)) and three preoperative refraction groups (SE\u2264-3 (n= 17),-3 to 0 (n= 15), and> 0 (n= 9)). Pearson correlation coefficient and two-way ANOVA were performed to analyze crystalline lens geometry as a function of preoperative refraction and age.Results: LT negatively correlated with refraction between ages 65 and 72 (Rho=-0.76, p= 0.004), increased with age in the refraction group with SE\u2264-3 (Rho= 0.75, p= 0.001), positively correlated with age across all ages combined (Rho= 0.53, p< 0.05), and negatively correlated with pupil size (Rho=-0.52, p< 0.05). RAL decreased with \u2026",

    "title": "Automatic parameter tuning for plug-and-play algorithms using generalized cross validation and Stein's unbiased risk estimation for linear inverse problems in computational imaging",
    "abstract": "We propose two automatic parameter tuning methods for Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithms that use CNN denoisers. We focus on linear inverse problems and propose an iterative algorithm to calculate generalized cross-validation (GCV) and Stein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unbiased risk estimator (SURE) functions for a half-quadratic splitting-based PnP (PnP-HQS) algorithm that uses a state-of- the-art CNN denoiser. The proposed methods leverage forward mode automatic differentiation to calculate the GCV and SURE functions and tune the parameters of a PnP-HQS algorithm automatically by minimizing the GCV and SURE functions using grid search. Because linear inverse problems appear frequently in computational imaging, the proposed methods can be applied in various domains. Furthermore, because the proposed methods rely on GCV and SURE functions, they do not require access to the ground truth image and do not require collecting an additional training dataset, which is highly desirable for imaging applications for which acquiring data is costly and time-consuming. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods on deblurring and MRI experiments and show that the GCV-based proposed method achieves comparable performance to that of the oracle tuning method that adjusts the parameters by maximizing the structural similarity index between the ground truth image and the output of the PnP algorithm. We also show that the SURE-based proposed method often leads to worse performance compared to the GCV-based proposed method.",

    "title": "Ultrasound elasticity reconstruction with inaccurate forward model using integrated data-driven correction of data-fidelity gradient",
    "abstract": "Ultrasound elasticity images which provide quantitative visualization of tissue stiffness are reconstructed based on solving an inverse problem. Classical model-based methods are usually formulated in terms of constrained optimization problems composed of a data-fidelity term and a regularization term. The data-fidelity term incorporates the physical forward model which arises from the governing equilibrium equation discretized by finite element methods (FEMs). In elastography, the physical forward model is directly governed by the measured displacement image which leads to an inaccurate forward model in the presence of an intermediate level of noise. To tackle this issue, in the first step, we utilize a statistical representation of the physical forward model which incorporates the noise statistics with a signal-dependent correlated noise model. Next, for compensating the inaccurate forward operator error, we introduce an explicit data-driven approach for correcting the data-fidelity gradient, which can be integrated with any regularization term. The constrained optimization problem is solved using the fixed-point gradient descent where the analytical gradient of the data-fidelity term is corrected using the nonlinear mapping of a deep neural network (DNN). Finally, the proposed approach is integrated with a data-driven regularizer based on REgularization by Denoising (RED) for incorporating the prior information about the underlying elasticity patterns. Our simulation and experimental results demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed approach in various scenarios.",

    "title": "Deep-learning based insitu ultrasound thermometry for thermal ablation monitoring",
    "abstract": "Noninvasive in situ temperature measurement (thermometry) is an attractive means of mapping the region of thermal damage during thermal ablation treatments. Existing methods of ultrasound thermometry are ineffective beyond 50\u2009\u00b0C due to multiple physical limitations, including a non-monotonic relationship between temperature and sound speed that reaches a plateau around 60\u2009\u00b0C, tissue phase transitions and deformation. An ultrasound-based technology that can monitor treatment over the entire therapeutic temperature range is desirable clinically. This paper describes a deep learning-based approach that uses thermometry data from the periphery of the heating zone (where temperatures are less than 50\u2009\u00b0C) to infer temperature throughout the treatment zone. Spatiotemporal 2D temperature maps from 3\u201312 s HIFU heating exposures (in 0.5 s increments) were generated (using COMSOL) with a subset \u2026",

However, adaptation to increasingly dynamic environments as well as demands for real-time processing of streaming data pose major challenges to this end. In this context, we develop novel algorithms for online network topology inference given streaming observations assumed to be smooth on the sought graph. Unlike existing batch algorithms, our goal is to track the (possibly) time-varying network topology while maintaining the memory and computational costs in check by processing graph signals sequentially-in-time. To recover the graph in an online fashion, we leverage proximal gradient (PG) methods to solve a judicious smoothness-regularized, time-varying optimization problem.

    "abstract": "Graph signal processing (GSP) is a key tool for satisfying the growing demand for information processing over networks. However, the success of GSP in downstream learning and inference tasks is heavily dependent on the prior identification of the relational structures. Graphs are natural descriptors of the relationships between entities of complex environments. The underlying graph is not readily detectable in many cases and one has to infer the topology from the observed signals. Firstly, we address the problem of graph signal classification by proposing a novel framework for discriminative graph learning. To learn discriminative graphs, we invoke the assumption that signals belonging to each class are smooth with respect to the corresponding graph while maintaining non-smoothness with respect to the graphs corresponding to other classes. Secondly, we extend our work to tackle increasingly dynamic \u2026",

    "title": "11 Compressed Sensing Methods for Radar Imaging in the Presence of Phase Errors and Moving Objects",
    "abstract": "Compressed sensing (CS) is a useful tool for processing sparse signals, ie, signals that have a few large values and many small or zero values. In [1], the authors state that if an object has a sparse representation in a basis, a lesser number of nonadaptive measurements contains enough information to reconstruct the object via basis pursuit. A dictionary for sparse representation can be implicitly defined through a transform or explicitly defined through a collection of signals that can represent an object or a signal in a compressed form, eg, a piece-wise smooth object can be represented by only a few coefficients after taking a wavelet transform, or a narrow-band signal can be described in terms of a few entries of a dictionary consisting of exponential signals with varying frequencies. In the former case, CS reconstruction can be described as a dictionary-less approach, whereas in the latter case, it can be described as a dictionary-based approach. In [2], the authors explain that a sparse or piece-wise constant signal can be recovered from a random number of its partial Fourier coefficients. Cand\u00e8s and Tao show in [3] that a measured coded signal corrupted by errors can be recovered using linear programming, provided the signal is sparse and there are certain constraints on the coding matrix. References [4, 5] provide a review of CS, as well as identify potential application areas for data compression, channel coding, inverse problems, data acquisition, single-pixel imaging, etc.The purpose of radar imaging is to extract an underlying signal present in the electromagnetic data received by an antenna. The underlying signal can be the image of an \u2026",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) requires at least fifteen raw images to extend the spatial resolution to the half of the diffraction limit in both axial and lateral directions. This requirement can cause motion artifacts in a reconstructed super-resolution image. Therefore, reducing the acquisition duration of raw images is of interest. Here, we propose a novel method, which applies compressed sensing (CS) to 3D-SIM and enables faster raw image acquisitions. CS allows us to record a scene with a photomultiplier tube, which is much faster than a camera. Furthermore CS can recover the scene from a small number of measurements. The combination of these two facts leads to significant reduction of the overall acquisition time. In preliminary experiments, a computer-generated ground truth image is utilized to simulate the proposed method, and the spatial resolution of an image produced by \u2026",

    "abstract": "We propose a sparsity-driven method for coupled image formation and autofocusing based on multi-channel data collected in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IfSAR). Relative phase between SAR images contains valuable information. For example, it can be used to estimate the height of the scene in SAR interferometry. However, this relative phase could be degraded when independent enhancement methods are used over SAR image pairs. Previously, Ramakrishnan et al. proposed a coupled multi-channel image enhancement technique, based on a dual descent method, which exhibits better performance in phase preservation compared to independent enhancement methods. Their work involves a coupled optimization formulation that uses a sparsity enforcing penalty term as well as a constraint tying the multichannel images together to preserve the cross-channel information.

Unlike existing sparse processing techniques that use fixed dictionaries based on a linear deformation model, we use a variable dictionary for the non-linear deformation in the form of seasonal sinusoidal deformation, in addition to the fixed dictionary for the linear deformation. We estimate the amplitude of the sinusoidal deformation using an optimization method and create the variable dictionary using the estimated amplitude. We show preliminary results using simulated data that demonstrate the soundness of our proposed technique for sparse 4D TomoSAR imaging in the presence of non-linear deformation.",

    "abstract": "Recently, retail product recognition has become an interesting computer vision research topic. The classification of products on shelves is a very challenging classification problem because many product classes are visually similar in terms of shape, color, texture, and metric size. In shelves, same or similar products are more likely to appear adjacent to each other and displayed in certain arrangements rather than at random. The arrangement of the products on the shelves has a spatial continuity both in brand and metric size. By using this context information, the co-occurrence of the products and the adjacency relations between the products can be statistically modeled. In this work, we present a context-aware hybrid classification system for the problem of fine-grained product class recognition. The proposed hybrid approach improves the accuracy of the context-free image classifiers, by combining them with a probabilistic graphical model based on Hidden Markov Models. The fundamental goal of this paper is to use contextual relationships in retail shelves to improve accuracy of the product classifier.",

Based on this perspective, we formulate the problem of SAR imaging of motion-containing scenes as one of joint imaging and phase error compensation. The proposed method is based on the minimization of a cost function which involves sparsity-imposing regularization terms on the reflectivity field to be imaged, considering that it admits a sparse representation as well as on the spatial structure of the motion-related phase errors, reflecting the assumption that only a small percentage of the entire scene contains moving objects. To incorporate the spatial structure of the phase errors into the problem, we provide three different sparsity-enforcing prior terms.

First step towards understanding the structure-function relationship is to group spines into main spine classes reported in the literature. Shape analysis of dendritic spines can help neuroscientists understand the underlying relationships. Due to unavailability of reliable automated tools, this analysis is currently performed manually which is a time-intensive and subjective task. Several studies on spine shape classification have been reported in the literature, however, there is an on-going debate on whether distinct spine shape classes exist or whether spines should be modeled through a continuum of shape variations. Another challenge is the subjectivity and bias that is introduced due to the supervised nature of classification approaches. In this paper, we \u2026",

VSNs consist of a network of image sensors, embedded processors, and wireless transceivers which are powered by batteries. The constraints on energy and bandwidth resources challenge setting up a tracking system in VSNs. In this chapter, we present a sparsity-driven decentralized framework for multi-camera human tracking in VSNs. The traditional centralized approaches involve sending compressed images to a central processing unit, which, in the case of severe bandwidth constraints, can hurt the performance of further processing (i.e., tracking) because of low-quality images.

    "abstract": "This chapter is concerned with the application of sparsity and compressed sensing ideas in imaging radars, also known as synthetic aperture radars (SARs). We provide a brief overview of how sparsity-driven imaging has recently been used in various radar imaging scenarios. We then focus on the problem of imaging from undersampled data, and point to recent work on the exploitation of compressed sensing theory in the context of radar imaging. We consider and describe in detail the geometry and measurement model for multi-static radar imaging, where spatially distributed multiple transmitters and receivers are involved in data collection from the scene to be imaged. The mono-static case, where transmitters and receivers are collocated is treated as a special case. For both the mono-static and the multi-static scenarios we examine various ways and patterns of undersampling the data. These patterns reflect \u2026",

    "abstract": "Analysing morphological and volumetric properties of dendritic spines from 2-photon microscopy images has been of interest to neuroscientists in recent years. Developing robust and reliable tools for automatic analysis depends on the segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose a new segmentation algorithm for dendritic spine segmentation based on watershed and active contour methods. First, our proposed method coarsely segments the dendritic spine area using the watershed algorithm. Then, these results are further refined using a region-based active contour approach. We compare our results and the results of existing methods in the literature to manual delineations of a domain expert. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method produces more accurate results than the existing algorithms proposed for dendritic spine segmentation.",

    "abstract": "One of the widely studied electroencephalography (EEG) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) set ups involves having subjects type letters based on so-called P300 signals generated by their brains in response to unpredictable stimuli. Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG signals, current BCI typing systems need several stimulus repetitions to obtain acceptable accuracy, resulting in low typing speed. However, in the context of typing letters within words in a particular language, neighboring letters would provide information about the current letter as well. Based on this observation, we propose an approach for incorporation of such information into a BCI-based speller through a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained by a Turkish language model. We describe smoothing and Viterbi algorithms for inference over such a model. Experiments on real EEG data collected in our laboratory demonstrate that incorporation of the language model in this manner leads to significant improvements in classification accuracy and bit rate.",

Although the ships in offshore areas can be easily detected, the ones near the shores or close to each other are difficult to detect. Furthermore, segmentation and classification of such ships is extremely difficult. In this study, a novel approach is presented for the fast and accurate segmentation of ship boundaries with minimal user interaction. In this approach, the rough location and orientation of a ship is determined by the user. Then, a ship model, which is constructed from synthetic ship images, is fitted on to the ship selected by the user and accurate ship boundaries are extracted. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by experimental results.",

Non-homogeneity of foreground and background regions of objects to be segmented complicates the process of segmentation. Low quality of images and noise can be considered as reasons of this problem. Furthermore these regions themselves can be textured. One approach proposed for solving challenging segmentation problems involves the use of shape priors. Progress has been made on segmentation of in low quality images, by using shape. However, since most existing shape-based segmentation methods are based on the assumption of homogeneity of background and foreground regions, they do not perform well under the types of conditioned described above.

The constructed transportation infrastructures had drastically changed the land-use profile and still have negative impacts on environment.

In order to detect changes and to predict the potential impacts, former land-use, transport infrastructure data were integrated with satellite images retrieved in 1963, 1987, 1992, and 2002.

    "abstract": "Most imaging systems are adversely affected by the errors in the observation model. One significant example is encountered in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging. Inexact measurement of the distance between the SAR sensing platform and the scene center or random delays on the transmitted signal result in model errors. These errors appear as phase errors in the SAR data and they cause defocusing of the reconstructed image. Mostly, phase errors vary only in the cross-range direction. However, in many scenarios, it is possible to encounter 2D phase errors, which are both range and cross-range dependent. In this study, a sparsity-driven method for joint SAR imaging and phase error estimation is proposed. This method is able to correct 1D as well as 2D phase errors. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Detection of Eye Blinks from EEG using Hidden Markov Models Page 1 Eye blinks are one of the \nmajor sources of physiological noise during electroencephalography (EEG) recordings [1]. There \nare two aspects in detecting eye blinks, automatic removal of eye blink artifacts and assessing \nthe quality of the EEG record (in terms of its degradation due to eye blinks) for experiments \nsuch as brain computer interfaces (BCIs). In this paper, hidden Markov models (HMMs) are \nused to detect eye blinks from fronto-polar electrodes (Fp1 and Fp2) of EEG recordings.

Previous approaches to drowsiness detection primarily make pre-assumptions about the relevant behavior, focusing on blink rate, eye closure, and yawning. Here we employ machine learning to datamine actual human behavior during drowsiness episodes. Automatic classifiers for 30 facial actions from the facial action coding system were developed using machine learning on a separate database of spontaneous expressions. These facial actions include blinking and yawn motions, as well as a number of other facial movements. These measures were passed to learning-based classifiers such as Adaboost and multinomial ridge regression. Head motion information was collected through automatic eye tracking and an accelerometer. The system was able to predict sleep and crash episodes on a simulator with 98% accuracy across subjects. It is the highest prediction rate reported to date for detecting drowsiness. Moreover, the analysis revealed new information about human facial behavior for drowsy drivers.",

Neighboring anatomical structures in the human brain exhibit co-dependencies which can aid in segmentation, if properly analyzed and modeled. Motivated by this observation, we formulate the segmentation problem as a maximum a posteriori estimation problem, in which we incorporate statistical prior models on the shapes and inter-shape (relative) poses of the structures of interest. This provides a principled mechanism to bring high level information about the shapes and the relationships of anatomical structures into the segmentation problem. For learning the prior densities based on training data, we use a nonparametric multivariate kernel density estimation framework. We combine these priors with data in a variational framework, and develop an active contour-based iterative segmentation algorithm. We test our method on the problem of volumetric segmentation of basal ganglia structures in magnetic resonance (MR) images. We compare our technique with existing methods and demonstrate the improvements it provides in terms of segmentation accuracy.",

Phase errors occur when the time required for the transmitted signal from SAR to the target and back cannot be obtained properly either because the distance between the SAR platform and the target cannot be measured exactly or in the case of random delays in the signal due to propagation in atmospheric turbulence. Phase errors cause blurring of the reconstructed image in the cross range direction.

    "abstract": "In this paper, some of the factors that affect classification performance of EEG based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) is studied. Study is specified on P300 speller system which is also an EEG based BCI system. P300 is a physiological signal that represents a response of brain to a given stimulus which occurs right 300ms afier the stimulus onset. When this signal occurs, it changes the continuous EEG some micro volts. Since this is not a very distinguished change, some other physiological signals (movement of muscles and heart, blinking or other neural activities) may distort this signal. In order to understand if there is really a P300 component in the signal, consecutive P300 epochs are averaged over trials. In this study, we have been tried two different multi channel data handling methods with two different frequency windows. Resulted data have been classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM). It has been shown that proposed method has a better classification performance.",

    "title": "A Novel feature extraction method for improving P300-speller performance",
    "abstract": "A P300 speller system has a 6x6 symbol matrix whose rows and columns are intensified in random order. Thus, two evoked single trials, P300s, occur for a symbol at each repetition. One repetition is completed once all rows and columns in the matrix are intensified. The symbol to be written is determined by detecting the P300 signal, which is generated when the subject counts number of times the given symbol is intensified. Traditionally, evoked activity is extracted using binary classification with a long feature vector consisting of individual electrodes, and averaging over several repetitions. What we have done here is a novel feature extraction method for rapid classification of P300. The method does averaging not only over trials but also electrodes. The underlying assumption is as follows; every electrode in frontocentral and centroparietal region has different background EEG activity but almost similar evoked activity with some little time shift called latency. Since the latency between electrodes is at most roughly 30 ms and background EEG activities have different patterns, averaging both over repetitions and electrodes increases P300 signal to background EEG noise ratio faster using less trials than traditional approach. Traditional and proposed feature extraction methods are tested on BCI Competition III P300-speller dataset by using Support Vector Machines. Classification performance of traditional and proposed methods with 3 electrodes (Fz, Cz, Pz) and 3 repetitions was 75% and 92% respectively. Testing the method in an online P300 speller system with an online artifact rejection algorithm will be our next work.",

We present a methodology using an overcomplete dictionary and sparsifying regularization to characterize anisotropy (aspect-dependent scattering amplitude), and migration (aspectdependent scattering center spatial location), into the image formation process. We also introduce regularization terms in the normal parameter space of the Hough transform that favor solutions with sparsity along a line and consequently parsimony in the representation of glint anisotropy. The characterization of scatterer migration directly gives information about size and shape of objects in the spatial domain and such information can also be inferred from the parsimonious representations we extract for glint-type scattering.",

    "abstract": "Recently, retail product recognition has become an interesting computer vision research topic. The classification of products on shelves is a very challenging classification problem because many product classes are visually similar in terms of shape, color, texture, and metric size. In shelves, same or similar products are more likely to appear adjacent to each other and displayed in certain arrangements rather than at random. The arrangement of the products on the shelves has a spatial continuity both in brand and metric size. By using this context information, the co-occurrence of the products and the adjacency relations between the products can be statistically modeled. In this work, we present a context-aware hybrid classification system for the problem of fine-grained product class recognition. The proposed hybrid approach improves the accuracy of the context-free image classifiers, by combining them with a probabilistic graphical model based on Hidden Markov Models. The fundamental goal of this paper is to use contextual relationships in retail shelves to improve accuracy of the product classifier.",

First step to incorporate spine shape information into functional coupling is classifying main spine shapes that were proposed in the literature. Due to the lack of reliable and fully automatic tools to analyze the morphology of the spines, such analysis is often performed manually, which is a laborious and time intensive task and prone to subjectivity. In this paper we present an automated approach to extract features using basic image processing techniques, and classify spines into mushroom or stubby by applying machine learning algorithms.

There are ongoing efforts to use brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in various ways to increase the benefits of such rehabilitation protocols to patients. An interesting claim is that if a system can detect the intention level of a patient and update the daily program according to this patient\u2019s motivation, the gain from these rehabilitation protocol can be increased. In this study, a system that records the electroencephalography (EEG) signals of healthy users performing arm movements against two levels of force has been designed based on the assumption that intention level is proportional to the level of motor task difficulty. EEG signals from 7 healthy subjects and 3 channels were recorded while subjects were performing work against two different levels of force. We calculated frequency bands of these channels and applied linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for classification of two environments corresponding to two motor task difficulty levels and resting state.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, an electroencephalogram (EEG) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is integrated with a robotic system designed to target rehabilitation therapies of stroke patients such that patients can control the rehabilitation robot by imagining movements of their right arm. In particular, the power density of frequency bands are used as features from the EEG signals recorded during the experiments and they are classified by Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). As one of the novel contributions of this study, the posterior probabilities extracted from the classifier are directly used as the continuous-valued outputs, instead of the discrete classification output commonly used by BCI systems, to control the speed of the therapeutic movements performed by the robotic system. Adjusting the exercise speed of patients online, as proposed in this study, according to the instantaneous levels of motor imagery during the movement, has the potential to increase efficacy of robot assisted therapies by ensuring active involvement of patients. The proposed BCI-based robotic rehabilitation system has been successfully implemented on physical setups in our laboratory and sample experimental data are presented.",

Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG signals, current BCI typing systems need several stimulus repetitions to obtain acceptable accuracy, resulting in low typing speed. However, in the context of typing letters within words in a particular language, neighboring letters would provide information about the current letter as well. Based on this observation, we propose an approach for incorporation of such information into a BCI-based speller through a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained by a Turkish language model. We describe smoothing and Viterbi algorithms for inference over such a model. Experiments on real EEG data collected in our laboratory demonstrate that incorporation of the language model in this manner leads to significant improvements in classification accuracy and bit rate.",

Inexact measurement of the distance between the SAR sensing platform and the scene center or random delays on the transmitted signal result in model errors. These errors appear as phase errors in the SAR data and they cause defocusing of the reconstructed image. Mostly, phase errors vary only in the cross-range direction. However, in many scenarios, it is possible to encounter 2D phase errors, which are both range and cross-range dependent. In this study, a sparsity-driven method for joint SAR imaging and phase error estimation is proposed. This method is able to correct 1D as well as 2D phase errors. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "The province of \u00f8stanbul and its immediate surroundings have been facing serious environmental problems within the past forty years due to migration from the rural areas, industrial and tourismoriented investment. The city has about 20% of the total population of the country while it makes up only 0.74% of the total surface area of Turkey. The conventional methods of urban data collection and analysis cannot deliver necessary information in a timely and cost effective fashion. To meet the demand for current and accurate data remotely sensed images are increasingly used as a source of data. As the resolution of remotely sensed data increases, more detailed information can be obtained. In this study, the Tuzla region, located in the east coastline of \u00f8stanbul, was examined. At the beginning this region developed as a small village having flat, productive agricultural lands and had summer residential area characteristics, then it developed rapidly because of regional investments. As for the satellite images in the study, SPOT satellite images dated 1999, IRS1C dated 2000, and LANDSAT 7 TM dated 2001 were used. For detection of buildings from satellite images, many image fusion algorithms and a high pass filtering technique have been used. At the end of the study, a comparison of these methods has been made.",

However, defining probability densities in the space of shapes is an open and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric shape prior model for image segmentation problems. In particular, given example training shapes, we estimate the underlying shape distribution by extending a Parzen density estimator to the space of shapes. Such density estimates are expressed in terms of distances between shapes, and we propose two distance metrics that could be used in this framework. We then incorporate the learned shape prior distribution into a maximum a posteriori estimation framework for segmentation. This results in an optimization problem, which we solve using active contours. We demonstrate the \u2026",

    "abstract": "The rapid and spontaneous morphological changes of dendritic spines have been an important observation to understand how information is stored in brain. Manual assessment of spine structure has been a useful tool to understand the differences between wild type (normal) and diseased cases. In order to perform a more through analysis, automatic tools need to be developed due to the immense amount of image data collected throughout the experiments. Additionally, dendritic spines are very dynamic structures and florescence microscopy contains high level of noise, blur and shift due to the optical properties. In this study, we track locations of dendritic spines in a full series of a time-lapse two photon microscopic images. To achieve this we propose a combined detection and tracking framework. For the detection we use a SIFT based algorithm, while the tracking requires a combination of registration and distance based spine matching. Experimental results show that this technique helps to track detected spines in time series even though the noise or blur deformed the image and complicated the detection.",

Although the ships in offshore areas can be easily detected, the ones near the shores or close to each other are difficult to detect. Furthermore, segmentation and classification of such ships is extremely difficult.

In this approach, the rough location and orientation of a ship is determined by the user.

Specific to this study, the posterior probabilities extracted from the classifier, are selected as continuous output instead of discrete classification output and are used to determine the speed of the therapeutic movements imposed by the robotic system. Changing the exercise speed of the patient according to the momentarily imagination levels during the movement, has the potential to augment the activity of the robot supported therapy by providing active involvement of the patient to the therapy.

    "abstract": "1 ObjectivesThe objective of the research program is to develop an integrated systems theory for automated target exploitation (ATE) that jointly treats information fusion, control, and adaptation using multiple, dynamic multi-modal sensor platforms in resource constrained environments. The research program addresses three inter-related research challenge areas, with an emphasis on the crosscoupling issues between these areas. The program is developing techniques for optimal, robust information fusion in uncertain environments. Graphical models are used to aggregate information at multiple levels and scales in architectures that incorporate both top-down (context and behavior) and bottom-up (feature and shape parameter) information flows. Graphical models also exploit statistical structure to manage computational complexity and facilitate on-line learning. Information-theoretic performance metrics are used to evaluate overall ATE performance and to inform both sensor management and front-end processing. These metrics provide for consistent fusion of disparate sources, enabling multi-sensor, multi-modal solutions. Optimal fusion is achieved by coupling with both inference-directed innovative front-end processing and dynamic sensor resource management that supports ATE inference. Front-end signal processing algorithms aim to extract optimal feature sets from sparse aperture data. The program develops robust, decisiondirected imaging and reconstruction methods that can adapt to context and to changing inference objectives. Non-myopic sensor management and control strategies for sensor platform trajectories are developed \u2026",

    "abstract": "The computer vision field has advanced to the point that we are now able to begin to apply automatic facial expression recognition systems to important research questions in behavioral science. The machine perception lab at UC San Diego has developed a system based on machine learning for fully automated detection of 30 actions from the facial action coding system (FACS). The system, called Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox (CERT), operates in real-time and is robust to the video conditions in real applications. This paper describes two experiments which are the first applications of this system to analyzing spontaneous human behavior: Automated discrimination of posed from genuine expressions of pain, and automated detection of driver drowsiness. Issues for application of machine learning systems to facial expression analysis are discussed.",

    "abstract": "We present an evaluation of the impact of a recently proposed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging technique on feature enhancement and automatic target recognition (ATR) performance. This image formation technique is based on non-quadratic optimization, and the images it produces appear to exhibit enhanced features. In the first part of this paper, we quantify such feature enhancement through a number of criteria. The findings of our analysis indicate that the new feature-enhanced SAR image formation method provides images with higher resolution of scatterers, and better separability of different regions as compared to conventional SAR images. In the second part of this paper, we provide an ATR-based evaluation. We run recognition experiments using conventional and feature-enhanced SAR images of military targets, with three different classifiers. The first classifier is template-based. The second classifier makes a decision through a likelihood test, based on Gaussian models for reflectivities. The third classifier is based on extracted locations of the dominant target scatterers. The experimental results demonstrate that the new feature-enhanced SAR imaging method can improve the recognition performance, especially in scenarios involving reduced data quality or quantity.",

    "abstract": "Building safety-critical real-time systems out of inexpensive, non-real-time, COTS components is challenging. Although COTS components generally offer high performance, they can occasionally incur significant timing delays. To prevent this, we propose controlling the operating point of each shared resource (like the cache, memory, and interconnection buses) to maintain it below its saturation limit. This is necessary because the low-level arbiters of these shared resources are not typically designed to provide real-time guarantees. In this work, we introduce a novel system execution model, the Predictable Execution Model (PREM), which, in contrast to the standard COTS execution model, coschedules at a high level all active components in the system, such as CPU cores and I/O peripherals. In order to permit predictable, system-wide execution, we argue that real-time embedded applications should be compiled \u2026",

Unlike previous systems, KCoFI protects commodity operating systems from classical control-flow hijack attacks, return-to-user attacks, and code segment modification attacks. We formally verify a subset of KCoFI's design by modeling several features in small-step semantics and providing a partial proof that the semantics maintain control-flow integrity. The model and proof account for operations such as page table management, trap handlers, context switching, and signal delivery. Our evaluation shows that KCoFI prevents all the gadgets found by an open-source Return Oriented Programming (ROP) gadget-finding tool in the FreeBSD kernel from being used, it also reduces the number of indirect control-flow targets \u2026",

The approach, which we call Secure Virtual Architecture (SVA), defines a virtual, low-level, typed instruction set suitable for executing all code on a system, including kernel and application code. SVA code is translated for execution by a virtual machine transparently, offline or online. SVA aims to enforce fine-grained (object level) memory safety, control-flow integrity, type safety for a subset of objects, and sound analysis. A virtual machine implementing SVA achieves these goals by using a novel approach that exploits properties of existing memory pools in the kernel and by preserving the kernel's explicit control over memory, including custom allocators and explicit deallocation. Furthermore, the safety properties can be encoded compactly as \u2026",

An OS compromise gives the attacker complete access to all of an application's data, regardless of how well the application is built. We propose a new system, Virtual Ghost, that protects applications from a compromised or even hostile OS. Virtual Ghost is the first system to do so by combining compiler instrumentation and run-time checks on operating system code, which it uses to create ghost memory that the operating system cannot read or write. Virtual Ghost interposes a thin hardware abstraction layer between the kernel and the hardware that provides a set of operations that the kernel must use to manipulate hardware, and provides a few trusted services for secure applications such as ghost memory \u2026",

Bugs in such low-level interactions can lead to violations of the memory safety guarantees provided by a safe execution environment and can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities in system software. In this work, we present a set of program analysis and run-time instrumentation techniques that ensure that errors in these low-level operations do not violate the assumptions made by a safety checking system. Our design introduces a small set of abstractions and interfaces for manipulating processor state, kernel stacks, memory mapped I/O objects, MMU mappings, and self modifying code to achieve this goal, without moving resource allocation and management decisions out of the kernel. We have added these techniques to a compiler-based virtual machine called Secure Virtual Architecture (SVA), to which the standard Linux kernel has been ported previously. Our design changes to SVA required only an additional 100 lines of code to be changed in this kernel. Our experimental results show that our techniques prevent reported memory safety violations due to low-level Linux operations and that these violations are not prevented by SVA without our techniques. Moreover, the new techniques in this paper introduce very little overhead over and above the existing overheads of SVA. Taken together, these results indicate that it is clearly worthwhile to add these techniques to an existing memory safety system.",

Further, in recent times, the computer systems community has started to pay increasing attention to non-performance measures, such as security, complexity, and power.

To support programs written in type-unsafe languages such as C, such tools need to add code into a program that must, at run-time, take a pointer into a memory object and locate metadata for that memory object. Current methods of locating metadata are either flexible (supporting metadata of varying sizes) at the expense of speed and scalability or are fast (e.g., by using shadow tables) at the cost of flexibility (metadata is small and must always be the same size).  This paper presents a new method of attaching metadata to memory objects, named Padding Area MetaData (PAMD), that is both flexible and efficient. Metadata can be any size, and different memory objects can have different sized metadata. While flexible, the algorithm for finding the metadata given a pointer into the memory object takes constant time. Our method \u2026",

Compilers defend against such fiends by inserting run-time checks to enforce semantic safety properties. Safe language compilers insert type checks for down-casts, information flow compilers [11] add run-time checks to prevent information leakage, and tools like SAFECode [8], WIT [1], and DFI [6] insert run-time checks to detect memory errors in C code. While effective, run-time checks often incur extra CPU and/or memory overhead. This is especially true when enforcing safety properties on C code [8, 1].Instead of detecting or tolerating violations of semantic safety properties, perhaps we can gain better performance by making the results of such violations unpredictable. Attackers often rely on violations of semantic safety properties having specific, predictable outcomes at the machine-code level. What if violations of safety properties could be guaranteed to produce unpredictable behavior? While randomization for security has been proposed for limited purposes [4, 5, 10, 15, 3], we believe that there is a more general principle afoot: many attacks utilizing semantic violations that are stopped using run-time checks can also be reliably thwarted using randomization techniques. The primary difference is that the former detects or prevents violations while the latter permits a violation but prevents an attacker from exploiting it.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of AArch64 processors in general-purpose computing, securing software running on AArch64 systems against control-flow hijacking attacks has become a critical part toward secure computation. Shadow stacks keep shadow copies of function return addresses and, when protected from illegal modifications and coupled with forward-edge control-flow integrity, form an effective and proven defense against such attacks. However, AArch64 lacks native support for write-protected shadow stacks, while software alternatives either incur prohibitive performance overhead or provide weak security guarantees. We present InversOS, the first hardware-assisted write-protected shadow stacks for AArch64 user-space applications, utilizing commonly available features of AArch64 to achieve efficient intra-address space isolation (called Privilege Inversion) required to protect shadow stacks. Privilege Inversion adopts unconventional design choices that run protected applications in the kernel mode and mark operating system (OS) kernel memory as user-accessible; InversOS therefore uses a novel combination of OS kernel modifications, compiler transformations, and another AArch64 feature to ensure the safety of doing so and to support legacy applications. We show that InversOS is secure by design, effective against various control-flow hijacking attacks, and performant on selected benchmarks and applications (incurring overhead of 7.0% on LMBench, 7.1% on SPEC CPU 2017, and 3.0% on Nginx web server).",

    "abstract": "Rust is one of the most promising systems programming languages to fundamentally solve the memory safety issues that have plagued low-level software for over forty years. However, to accommodate the scenarios where Rust's type rules might be too restrictive for certain systems programming and where programmers opt for performance over security checks, Rust opens security escape hatches allowing writing unsafe source code or calling unsafe libraries. Consequently, unsafe Rust code and directly-linked unsafe foreign libraries may not only introduce memory safety violations themselves but also compromise the entire program as they run in the same monolithic address space as the safe Rust. This problem can be mitigated by isolating unsafe memory objects (those accessed by unsafe code) and sandboxing memory accesses to the unsafe memory. One category of prior work utilizes existing program analysis frameworks on LLVM IR to identify unsafe memory objects and accesses. However, they suffer the limitations of prolonged analysis time and low precision. In this paper, we tackled these two challenges using summary-based whole-program analysis on Rust's MIR. The summary-based analysis computes information on demand so as to save analysis time. Performing analysis on Rust's MIR exploits the rich high-level type information inherent to Rust, which is unavailable in LLVM IR. This manuscript is a preliminary study of ongoing research. We have prototyped a whole-program analysis for identifying both unsafe heap allocations and memory accesses to those unsafe heap objects. We reported the overhead and the efficacy of \u2026",

    "abstract": "Despite its well-known lack of memory safety, C is still widely used to write both new code and to maintain legacy software. Extensive efforts to make C safe have not seen wide adoption due to poor performance and a lack of backward compatibility. Checked C is an open-source, safe extension to C that addresses these problems. This hands-on tutorial will introduce attendees to Checked C and provide guidance in the use of 3C, a semi-automatic tool that converts legacy C code to Checked C.",

    "abstract": "The increase in transistor capacity per die and the need to achieve higher performance in a power efficient way has led to the emergence of Chip Multi-Processor (CMP) architectures. These architectures are based on multiple processing cores on a single chip and have the potential to provide higher peak throughput, easier design scalability, and greater performance/power ratios than monolithic designs. Even though current implementations [3, 12, 27] use a modest number of cores (two to four), the trend is towards larger numbers of cores on each die [14]. In order for the applications to quickly adapt to this parallel multiprocessing environment, the proposed architectures use shared memory and private caches for fast memory accesses. This raises the need for cache coherency.Cache coherence (CC) is a key aspect in the design of shared-memory parallel systems. It is the mechanism that guarantees correctness \u2026",

However, using such privileges requires tedious reasoning of program behavior. We present a compiler, named AutoPriv, that uses wholeprogram analysis to transform programs to remove unneeded privileges during their execution. We tested AutoPriv on several privileged open-source programs that typically run as root. Our results show that AutoPriv increases optimization time by 19% on average but that transformed programs exhibit practically no overhead.",

To support this principle, fine-grain privilege mechanisms have been added to many commodity operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and Solaris;\u201croot\u201d privileges are essentially a union of these fine-grain privileges. However, these privilege mechanisms suffer from several weaknesses: they are non-uniform across systems, they are difficult to program, and they are easily susceptible to injected code attacks. Because of these shortcomings, these privilege mechanisms are rarely used in practice. In this paper, we present a new approach to specifying and enforcing privileges that addresses these drawbacks. We present a simple and portable annotation language for expressing the need for privilege, a compiler pass that can infer the privileges needed by an annotated program, and a new OS privilege enforcement mechanism that \u2026",

Here locality is defined by the distance of data reuse. Studying whole-program data reuse may reveal global patterns not apparent in short-distance reuses or local control flow. However, the analysis must meet two requirements to be useful. The first is efficiency. It needs to analyze all accesses to all data elements in full-size benchmarks and to measure distance of any length and in any required precision. The second is predication. Based on a few training runs, it needs to classify patterns as regular and irregular and, for regular ones, it should predict their (changing) behavior for other inputs. In this paper, we show that these goals are attainable through three techniques: approximate analysis of reuse distance (originally called LRU stack distance \u2026",

    "abstract": "As computer memory hierarchy becomes adaptive, its performance increasingly depends on forecasting the dynamic program locality. This paper presents a method that predicts the locality phases of a program by a combination of locality profiling and run-time prediction. By profiling a training input, it identifies locality phases by sifting through all accesses to all data elements using variable-distance sampling, wavelet filtering, and optimal phase partitioning. It then constructs a phase hierarchy through grammar compression. Finally, it inserts phase markers into the program using binary rewriting. When the instrumented program runs, it uses the first few executions of a phase to predict all its later executions.Compared with existing methods based on program code and execution intervals, locality phase prediction is unique because it uses locality profiles, and it marks phase boundaries in program code.

    "title": "Software behavior oriented parallelization",
    "abstract": "Many sequential applications are difficult to parallelize because of unpredictable control flow, indirect data access, and input-dependent parallelism. These difficulties led us to build a software system for behavior oriented parallelization (BOP), which allows a program to be parallelized based on partial information about program behavior, for example, a user reading just part of the source code, or a profiling tool examining merely one or few executions.The basis of BOP is programmable software speculation, where a user or an analysis tool marks possibly parallel regions in the code, and the run-time system executes these regions speculatively. It is imperative to protect the entire address space during speculation. The main goal of the paper is to demonstrate that the general protection can be made cost effective by three novel techniques: programmable speculation, critical-path minimization, and value-based \u2026",

This article addresses the analysis problem at the program level, where the size of data and the locality of execution may change significantly depending on the input.The article presents two techniques that predict how the locality of a program changes with its input. The first is approximate reuse-distance measurement, which is asymptotically faster than exact methods while providing a guaranteed precision. The second is statistical prediction of locality in all executions of a program based on the analysis of a few executions. The prediction process has three steps: dividing data \u2026",

    "abstract": "While the memory of most machines is organized as a hierarchy, program data are laid out in a uniform address space. This paper defines a model of reference affinity, which measures how close a group of data are accessed together in a reference trace. It proves that the model gives a hierarchical partition of program data. At the top is the set of all data with the weakest affinity. At the bottom is each data element with the strongest affinity. Based on the theoretical model, the paper presents k-distance analysis, a practical test for the hierarchical affinity of source-level data. When used for array regrouping and structure splitting, k-distance analysis consistently outperforms data organizations given by the programmer, compiler analysis, frequency profiling, statistical clustering, and all other methods we have tried.",

Until now, the principal focus of hardware and software innovations has been overcoming latency. However, the advent of latency tolerance techniques such as non-blocking cache and software prefetching begins the process of trading bandwidth for latency by overlapping and pipelining memory transfers. Since actual latency is the inverse of the consumed bandwidth, memory latency cannot be fully tolerated without infinite bandwidth. This perspective has led us to two questions. Do current machines provide sufficient data bandwidth? If not, can a program be restructured to consume less bandwidth? This paper answers these questions in two parts.

The paper first presents an algorithm efficient enough for off-line use to approximately measure the footprint with a guaranteed precision.

Till now, the analysis of program locality relies on expensive cache simulation. As machine cache becomes increasingly complex and adaptive, more efficient and accurate methods are needed to find the best cache configuration for each program or even each part of the program. In this report, we measure program locality directly by the distance between the reuses of its data. Data reuse is an inherent program property and does not depend on any cache parameters. Therefore, it allows quantitative measurement of program locality that is not tied to any particular machine. To measure reuse distance, we describe a new method consisting of two components. The first performs fast analysis for full applications accessing large data sets, and the second ascribes the simulation result to source-level data structures at fine granularity. With this tool, we analyze data reuse behavior in a set of benchmark applications and present main findings about their program locality.",

The new model extends prior work that assumes no data sharing and uniform thread interleaving. Based on a single pass over an interleaved execution trace, we compute a set of per-thread statistics that includes the effect of thread interleaving and data sharing. The per-thread statistics is then composed to predict performance for all cache sizes, either for sub-clusters of threads or for futuristic environments with a larger number of similar threads.We evaluate and validate our model against exhaustive simulation using a server application running on a quad-core machine and productivity, multimedia and gaming applications running on a dual-core machine. The results indicate that our model is accurate and relies on incorporating both irregular thread interleaving and data sharing to achieve this accuracy. In addition, it identifies and separates individual factors affecting locality and scalability and hence opens new possibilities in performance tuning, program scheduling, and hardware cache design for concurrent applications.",

Since memory data is transferred one cache block at a time, improving the utilization of cache blocks can directly improve memory bandwidth utilization and program performance.

This paper presents defensive tiling, a set of compiler techniques to estimate the effect of cache sharing and then choose the tile sizes that can provide robust performance in co-run environments.

    "abstract": "Software transactional memory systems enable a programmer to easily write concurrent data structures such as lists, trees, hashtables, and graphs, where non-conflicting operations proceed in parallel. Many of these structures take the abstract form of a dictionary, in which each transaction is associated with a search key. By regrouping transactions based on their keys, one may improve locality and reduce conflicts among parallel transactions. In this paper, we present an executor that partitions transactions among available processors. Our key-based adaptive partitioning monitors incoming transactions, estimates the probability distribution of their keys, and adaptively determines the (usually nonuniform) partitions. By comparing the adaptive partitioning with uniform partitioning and round-robin keyless partitioning on a 16-processor SunFire 6800 machine, we demonstrate that key-based adaptive partitioning \u2026",

In this paper, we use trace-based program locality analysis and make it efficient enough for dynamic use. We show a complete on-line system for periodically measuring the parallel execution, predicting and ranking cache interference for all co-run choices, and reorganizing programs based on the prediction.

Over the past four decades, there have been steady improvements in the algorithmic efficiency of reuse distance measurement. This progress is accelerating in recent years, both in theory and practical implementation.In this article, we present a kinetic model of LRU cache memory, based on the average eviction time (AET) of the cached data. The AET model enables fast measurement and use of low-cost sampling. It can produce the miss ratio curve in linear time with extremely low space costs. On storage trace benchmarks, AET reduces the time and space costs compared to former techniques. Furthermore, AET is a composable model that can characterize shared cache behavior through sampling and modeling individual programs or traces.",

This offers academic researchers the opportunity to attack the problems with a broader and longer-term view. Further, in recent times, the computer systems community has started to pay increasing attention to non-performance measures, such as security, complexity, and power.

Our approach can predict precise cache line granularity miss ratio curves for complex loops with non-linear array references and even branches. The precision and overhead of static sampling are evaluated using PolyBench and a bit-reversal loop.

In order to balance fairness and performance, we propose two elastic, or movable, cache allocation baselines: elastic miss ratio baseline (EMB) and elastic cache space baseline (ECB). Furthermore, we study optimal partitions for each baseline with different levels of elasticity, and show that EMB is more effective than ECB. We also classify programs from the SPEC 2006 benchmark suite based on how they benefit or suffer from the elastic baselines, and suggest essential information for customers and service provider to choose a baseline.",

In this paper, however, we consider its effect on energy. By merging program phases, fusion tends to increase the uniformity, or balance of demand for system resources. On a conventional superscalar processor, increased balance tends to increase IPC, and thus dynamic power, so that fusion-induced improvements in program energy are slightly smaller than improvements in program run time. If IPC is held constant, however, by reducing frequency and voltage - particularly on a processor with multiple clock domains - then energy improvements may significantly exceed run time improvements. We demonstrate the benefits of increased program balance under a theoretical model of processor energy consumption. We then evaluate the \u2026",

However, the existence of transient CPU caches in modern computer architectures brings a serious performance issue.

In this paper, we optimize data persistence by proposing a software cache. The software cache first buffers lines that need to be flushed, and then flushes them out at an appropriate later time. The software cache aims to maximize the combination of cache line flushes.

To support partial monitoring, this paper presents a framework that includes a source-to-source C compiler and a run-time monitor.

This is due in part to the difficulty of fully utilizing the deep and complex memory hierarchies found on most modern machines. In the past, various tools on performance tuning and prediction have been developed to improve machine utilization. However, these tools are not effective in practice because they either do not consider memory hierarchy or do so with expensive and machinespecific program simulations. In this paper, we first demonstrate that application performance is now primarily limited by memory bandwidth. With this observation, we describe a new approach based on estimating and monitoring memory bandwidth consumption, which can achieve accurate and efficient performance tuning and prediction. When evaluated on a 3000-line benchmark program, NAS/SP, the bandwidthbased method has enabled a user to obtain a speedup of 1.19 by inspecting and tuning only 5% of the source code. Furthermore its compile-time prediction of overall execution time was within 10% of the actual running time.",

We present a new technique to detect phases\u2014periods of distinctive behavior\u2014in service-oriented programs. We begin by using special inputs to induce a repeating pattern of behavior. We then employ frequency-based filtering on basic block traces to detect both top-level and second-level repetitions, which we mark via binary rewriting. When the instrumented program runs, on arbitrary input, the inserted markers divide execution into phases of varying length. Experiments with service-oriented programs from the Spec95 and Spec2K benchmark suites indicate that program behavior within phases is surprisingly predictable in many (though not all) cases. This in turn suggests that dynamic adaptation, either in hardware or in software, may be applicable to a wider class of programs than previously believed.",

    "abstract": "Improving program locality has become increasingly important on modern computer systems. An effective strategy is to group computations on the same data so that once the data are loaded into cache, the program performs all their operations before the data are evicted. However, computation regrouping is difficult to automate for programs with complex data and control structures. This paper studies the potential of locality improvement through trace-driven computation regrouping. First, it shows that maximizing the locality is different from maximizing the parallelism or maximizing the cache utilization. The problem is NP-hard even without considering data dependences and cache organization. Then the paper describes a tool that performs constrained computation regrouping on program traces. The new tool is unique because it measures the exact control dependences and applies complete memory renaming \u2026",

We show the generality in a hierarchical relation where collaborative caching subsumes non-collaborative caching, and within collaborative caching, the priority hint subsumes the previous binary hint.

Fusing loops that use the same data can reduce the distance between accesses to the same memory location, avoiding costly off-chip memory transfer. Most existing greedy fusion algorithms solve the unconstrained problem\u2014they do not guard against negative effects of excessive fusion. When a large program contains a great number of loops, unconstrained fusion may generate huge loops that overflow on-chip memory, leading to lower performance.This paper studies the problem for constrained weighted fusion, in which the graph edges carry weights indicating the profitability of fusing the inputs and vertices are annotated with resource requirements. The optimal solution of a constrained weighted fusion problem is a collection of vertex sets such that the total weight associated with pairs of vertices within clusters is maximized and the aggregate resource requirement of every cluster is less than a fixed upper bound R. Finding the optimal solution to a weighted fusion problem (constrained or unconstrained) is NP-complete, so we use heuristics. We present two methods. The first picks a group of loops at each fusion step. To ease the resource calculation and fusibility test, the second method picks only a pair of candidate loops at each step. The paper presents the two algorithms, their complexity, and an experimental evaluation.",

This would be fine if the cost/benefit of compilation was the same for every method of a given hotness, but that is not the case. In fact, compiling a large method will likely result in less overall speedup than compiling a smaller, equally hot method. This exposes an opportunity for improvement.

    "abstract": "Pipelining is commonly used in multi-threaded code. In pipeline programs, the computation is divided into stages that perform different types of computations. Unlike in a data parallel program, threads in a pipeline program have different behavior. Because of the asymmetry, the performance varies significantly depending on how threads are grouped to use the same shared cache. It is time consuming to find the best grouping through exhaustively testing. As the number of threads increases, testing is not scalable. This short paper presents model-assisted search. It profiles a program to find all-thread data sharing in training executions and predicts the cache performance for all thread groupings. From the prediction, inferior groupings are removed from consideration, leaving a smaller set of choices for test. The pruning uses a concept called the miss-count poset (partially ordered set). For an 8-thread pipeline program running on a hyper-threaded quad-core processor, we show that the best grouping is 70% faster than the worst and the proposed technique reduced the cost of testing by 64%.",

Increasingly in shared environments, especially compute clouds, users are unrelated to one another. In such circumstances, an overall gain in throughput does not justify an individual loss. This paper explores conservative sharing, which protects the cache occupancy for individual programs, but still enables full cache sharing whenever there is unused space.Specifically, we present a new hardware based mechanism called cache rationing. Each core/program is assigned a portion of the shared cache as its ration. The hardware support protects the ration so it cannot be taken away by peer programs while in use. However, a program can exceed its allocated ration only if another program has unused blocks in its ration. This paper shows that rationing provides both full protection and full utilization of the cache. In addition, the same hardware support can enable energy-efficient caching and hardware-software collaborative caching.",

At each moment of execution, a program may have a varied amount of work for each component. Recent development has exploited this imbalance to save energy by slowing the components that have a lower load. Example techniques include dynamic scaling and clock gating used in processors from Transmeta and Intel. Symmetrical to reconfiguring hardware is reorganizing software. We can alter program demand for different components by reordering program instructions. This paper explores the theoretical lower bound of energy consumption assuming that both a program and a machine are fully adjustable. It shows that a program with a balanced load always consumes less energy than the same program with uneven loads under the same execution speed. In addition, the paper examines the relation between energy consumption and program performance. It shows that reducing power is a different problem than that of improving performance. Finally, the paper presents empirical evidence showing that a program may be transformed to have a balanced demand in most parts of its execution.",

This paper presents the Fixed-size Uniform Lease (FUL) cache which has two novel properties. First, the FUL cache is programmable with a working-set parameter called a lease and a lease-based eviction method. Second, the FUL cache is performance safe in that the default parameter is guaranteed to produce the same performance as the traditional LRU cache. The system has been implemented on a Terasic Cyclone DE0-CV FPGA card with a RISC-V processor and the new hardware cache, and the evaluation has shown performance improvements over LRU in half of the 8 programs tested from the Polybench suite.",

In program code, the interface is used to mark the related computation and communication. There is no need to restructure the computation code or compose multiple messages. At run time, the message size is dynamically determined, and multiple pipelines are chained among all tasks that participate in the delta communication.

Traditional cache management is transparent to the workload: data that should be kept in cache are determined by the recency information only, while the program information, i.e., future data reuses, is not communicated to the cache. This has changed in a new cache design named Lease Cache. The program control is passed to the lease cache by a compiler technique called Compiler Assigned Reference Lease (CARL). This technique collects the reuse interval distribution for each reference and uses it to compute and assign the lease value to each reference.In this article, we prove that CARL is optimal under certain statistical assumptions. Based on this optimality, we prove miss curve convexity, which is useful for optimizing shared cache, and sub-partitioning monotonicity, which simplifies lease compilation. We evaluate the \u2026",

In non-scientific code, the potential parallelism often resides in while-loops rather than for-loops. The do-all model used in the past by many studies cannot detect this type of parallelism. A new, task-based model has been used by a number of recent studies and shown safe for general loops and functions. This paper presents a feedback-based compiler that measures the amount of safe task parallelism in a program and ranks the potential candidates. It solves two problems unique for task analysis. The first is the relation between loop parallelism and function parallelism. The second is the effect of the calling context. The new tool is built in the GCC compiler and used to analyze the entire suite of SPEC 2006 integer benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "The high performance of today\u2019s microprocessors is achieved mainly by fast, multipleissuing hardware and optimizing compilers that together exploit the instruction-level parallelism (ILP) in programs. Software pipelining is a popular loop optimization technique in today\u2019s ILP compilers. However, four difficulties may prevent the optimal performance of software pipelining: insufficient parallelism in innermost loops, the memory bottleneck, hardware under-utilization due to uncertain memory latencies, and unnecessary recurrences due to the reuse of registers (false recurrences).This research uses an outer-loop unrolling technique, unroll-and-jam, to solve the first and second problems. It shows, both in theory and experiment, that unroll-and-jam can solve the first problem by exploiting cross-loop parallelism in nested loops. Unroll-and-jam can also automatically remove memory bottlenecks for loops. This research discovered that for 22 benchmark and kernel loops tested, a speed improvement of over 50% is obtained by unroll-and-jam. For solving the uncertain memory latencies, this research uses a compiler technique, memory reuse analysis. Using memory reuse analysis can significantly improve hardware utilization. For the experimental suite of 140 benchmark loops tested, using memory reuse analysis reduced register cycle time usage by 29% to 54% compared to compiling the same loops assuming all memory accesses were cache misses.",

Data placement has been used as a major optimization method on such machines. This study examined the scalability and the e ect of data placement on a state-of-the-art ccNUMA machine, SGI Origin, using 16 processors. Three applications from SPLASH-2 are used, FFT, Radix and Barnes-Hut. The results showed that FFT and Radix cannot scale to 16 processors with 70% e ciency even for the largest data sizes tested. Barnes-Hut doesn't scale for small data size but scales linearly for large input size. The results also showed that data placement does not make any di erence on performance for all three applications. We attribute these results to the e ect of the advanced uni-processor used on the Origin, R10K, the optimizing compiler, and the aggressive communication architecture. Some of our results are quite di erent from the predictions of two recent simulation studies on directory-based ccNUMA machines (HSH96] and PRA97]), especially on FFT. These di erences are partly due to the fact that the machine models used in previous simulation studies are di erent from the Origin machine in some important aspects. Our results also include data sizes that are larger than any of the previous simulation studies. To increase our con dence on the latency numbers and data placement tools, we also measured memory latencies using micro-benchmarks.",

As a common limitation, however, the extent of the history being recorded is limited to either just the data in cache or, more recently, a larger but still finite-length window of accesses, because the cost of keeping a long history can easily outweigh its benefit.    This paper presents a statistical method to keep track of instruction pointer-based access reuse intervals of arbitrary length and uses this information to identify the Least Expected Use (LEU) blocks for replacement. LEU uses dynamic sampling supported by novel hardware that maintains a state to record arbitrarily long reuse intervals. LEU is evaluated using the Cache Replacement Championship simulator, tested on PolyBench and SPEC, and compared with five policies including a recent technique that approximates optimal caching using a fixed-length history.

However, most optimization techniques need to know more than the miss rate of the whole program. Many of them benefit from knowing miss rate of each execution phase of a program for all inputs.In this paper, we describe a method that divides a program into phases that have a regular locality pattern. Using a regression model, it predicts the reuse signature and then the cache miss rate of each phase for all inputs. We compare the prediction with the actual measurement. The average prediction is over 98% accurate for a set of floating-point programs. The predicted CMR-traces matches the simulated ones in spite of dramatic fluctuations of the miss rate over time. This technique can be used for improving dynamic optimization, benchmarking, and compiler design.",

Manually designed methods have been used in at least three important application domains---matrix operations, N-body simulation, and search trees---by different research groups using very different data layouts. This paper presents a new method for hierarchical data placement. The method is based on the reference affinity model, which captures the temporal pattern in program computation and converts it into the spatial relation in program data. The method is applicable to any sequential programs. It is polynomial time. It automatically gives the hierarchical data layout not only for cases reported by previous studies but also for other important problems. The new results reveal strong relations between computation and data and therefore should help to improve the management of data as well as the design of compilers and programming languages.",

There is no widely accepted measure of cache complexity, yet the cache complexity is often more important to performance than the measures of time and space complexity. This paper presents Data Movement Distance (DMD) to measure the cost of cache complexity for algorithms, demonstrates its use, and discusses it as a measure of locality. Since processor speeds are getting ever faster, one of the main bottlenecks in modern computing is moving the needed data into and around the processor. DMD measures the efficiency of the algorithm in this sense and therefore may be a much-needed complement to the conventional analysis of computation complexity. In this paper, we give an overview of DMD and some basic results. These will be expanded upon in future work.",

As an interface, it may be used in arbitrary ways, sometimes optimal but probably suboptimal most times and even counter productive. We develop a theoretical foundation for collaborative cache to show the inclusion principle and the existence of a distance metric we call LRU-MRU stack distance. The new stack distance is important for program analysis and transformation to target a hierarchical collaborative cache system rather than a single cache configuration. We use 10 benchmark programs to show that optimal caching may reduce the average miss ratio by 24%, and a simple feedback-driven compilation technique can utilize collaborative cache to realize 38% of the optimal improvement.",

We present a model for program memory usage with which we can show how effective multi-programming is likely to be. In addition, we present an automated system for adding control at the program level that allows runtime adaptation of a program\u2019s heap size. The process is fully automatic and requires no extra coding on the part of programmers. We discuss two adaptive schemes: the first acts independently, and while performing competitively, the system behaves politely in a multi-programmed environment.

    "abstract": "The data layout of a program is critical to performance because it determines the spatial locality of the data access. Most quantitative notions of spatial locality are based on the overall miss rate and leave three questions not fully answered: how much can the locality of a given data layout be improved, can a data layout be improved if the miss rate cannot be lowered, and can the overall spatial locality be decomposed into smaller components? This paper describes a new definition of spatial locality that addresses these questions. The model is based on off-line profiling of a sequential execution. It has been used to analyze the spatial locality of 14 SPEC2000 benchmarks.",

    "title": "Behavior-oriented parallelization",
    "abstract": "Many sequential applications are difficult to parallelize because of problems such as unpredictable data access, input-dependent parallelism, and custom memory management. These difficulties led us to build a system for behavior-oriented parallelization (BOP), which allows a program to be parallelized based on partial information about program behavior, for example, a user reading just part of the source code, or a profiling tool examining merely one or few inputs. The basis of BOP is programmable software speculation, where a user or an analysis tool marks possibly parallel regions in the code, and the run-time system executes these regions specul atively. It is imperative to protect the entire address space during speculation. The main goal of the paper is to demonstrate that the general protection can be made cost effective by three novel techniques: programmable speculation, critical-path minimization, and value-based correctness checking. On a recently acquired multi-core, multi-processor PC, the BOP system improved the whole-program performance by integer factors for a Lisp interpreter, a data com-pressor, a language parser, and a scientific library.",

    "abstract": "In POPL 2002, Petrank and Rawitz showed a universal result---finding optimal data placement is not only NP-hard but also impossible to approximate within a constant factor if P<> NP. Here we study a recently published concept called reference affinity, which characterizes a group of data that are always accessed together in computation. On the theoretical side, we give the complexity for finding reference affinity in program traces, using a novel reduction that converts the notion of distance into satisfiability. We also prove that reference affinity automatically captures the hierarchical locality in divide-and-conquer computations including matrix solvers and N-body simulation. The proof establishes formal links between computation patterns in time and locality relations in space. On the practical side, we show that efficient heuristics exist. In particular, we present a sampling method and show that it is more effective than the previously published technique, especially for data that are often but not always accessed together. We show the effect on generated and real traces. These theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that effective data placement is still attainable in general-purpose programs because common (albeit not all) locality patterns can be precisely modeled and efficiently analyzed.",

    "abstract": "As computer memory hierarchy becomes adaptive, its performance increasingly depends on forecasting the dynamic program locality. This paper presents a method that predicts the locality phases of a program by a combination of locality profiling and run-time prediction. By profiling a training input, it identifies locality phases by sifting through all accesses to all data elements using variabledistance sampling, wavelet filtering, and optimal phase partitioning. It then constructs a phase hierarchy through grammar compression. Finally, it inserts phase markers into the program using binary rewriting. When the instrumented program runs, it uses the first few executions of a phase to predict all its later executions. Compared with existing methods based on program code and execution intervals, locality phase prediction is unique because it uses locality profiles, and it marks phase boundaries in program code. The second half of the paper presents a comprehensive evaluation. It measures the accuracy and the coverage of the new technique and compares it with best known run-time methods. It measures its benefit in adaptive cache resizing and memory remapping. Finally, it compares the automatic analysis with manual phase marking. The results show that locality phase prediction is well suited for identifying large, recurring phases in complex programs.",

In 1970, Mattson et al. showed how to measure miss rates for all cache sizes. Recently, Zhong et al. showed how to predict miss rates for all program input data sizes. This paper builds on the previous results and shows the miss rate of a program as a function over the domain with cache and data input size as two orthogonal dimensions. This paper makes three contributions. First, it presents an interactive tool that visualizes the miss rates in threedimensional plots. It measures the compounded error of prediction for different cache sizes for program inputs that are never ran let along simulated on a cache simulator. Second, it applies predictions to a new set of benchmark programs with dynamic data structures. Finally, it discusses possible uses of the new tool. Experiments show that the compounded prediction error for the hit rate is within 6.5% for caches of all sizes and with a small amount of associativity. The visualization tool can run on any machine with Java 3D. It can be downloaded from http://www. cs. rochester. edu/research/locality.",

    "abstract": "Many computing problems benefit from dynamic data partitioning\u2014dividing a large amount of data into smaller chunks with better locality. When data can be sorted, two methods are commonly used in partitioning. The first selects pivots, which enable balanced partitioning but cause a large overhead of up to half of the sorting time. The second method uses simple functions, which is fast but requires that the input data con-firm to a uniform distribution. In this paper, we propose a new method, which partitions data using the cumulative distribution function. It partitions data of any distribution in linear time, independent to the number of sublists to be partitioned into. Experiments show 10-30% improvement in partitioning balance and 20-70% reduction in partitioning overhead. The new method is more scalable than existing methods. It yields greater benefit when the data set and the number of sub-lists grow larger. By applying this method, our sequential sorting beats Quick-sorting by 20% and parallel sorting exceeds the previous sorting algorithm by 33-50%.",

We propose a hardware-based mechanism called cache rationing. Each program is assigned a portion of the shared cache as its ration. The hardware support protects the ration so it cannot be taken away by peer programs while in use.

The two approaches intersect at a basic problem, which is how parallel tasks can best share the cache memory. The degree of sharing determines the available cache resource for each core and hence the memory performance and scalability of the system. In this paper, cache rationing is presented as a cache sharing solution for collaborative caching.",

Delta sends and recvs are dynamically chained to effect sender-receiver pipelining, which is superior to pipelining only at the sender or the receiver side.The evaluation uses kernel tests to find the best increment size for different MPI implementations and types of machines and networks.

    "title": "Distributive Program Parallelization Using a Suggestion",
    "abstract": "Most computing users today have access to clusters of multi-core computers. To fully utilize a cluster, a programmer must combine two levels of parallelism: shared-memory parallelism within a machine and distributed memory parallelism across machines. Such programming is difficult. Either a user has to mix two programming languages in a single program and use fixed computation and data partitioning between the two, or the user has to rewrite a program from scratch. Even after careful programming, a program may still have hidden concurrency bugs. Users who are accustomed to sequential programming do not find the same level of debugging and performance analysis support especially for a distributed environment.The paper presents a suggestion-based language that enables a user to parallelize a sequential program for distributed execution by inserting hints. The hints are safe against any type of misuse and expressive enough to specify independent, pipelined, and speculative parallel execution on a cluster of multi-core computers.",

    "abstract": "Fast track is a software speculation system that enables unsafe optimization of sequential code. It speculatively runs optimized code to improve performance and then checks the correctness of the speculative code by running the original program on multiple processors.We present the interface design and system implementation for Fast Track. It lets a programmer or a profiling tool mark fast-track code regions and uses a run-time system to manage the parallel execution of the speculative process and its checking processes and ensures the correct display of program outputs. The core of the run-time system is a novel concurrent algorithm that balances exploitable parallelism and available processors when the fast track is too slow or too fast. The programming interface closely affects the run-time support. Our system permits both explicit and implicit end markers for speculatively optimized code regions as well as extensions that allow the use of multiple tracks and user defined correctness checking. We discuss the possible uses of speculative optimization and demonstrate the effectiveness of our prototype system by examples of unsafe semantic optimization and a general system for fast memory-safety checking, which is able to reduce the checking time by factors between 2 and 7 for large sequential code on a 8-CPU system.",

    "abstract": "Software transactional memory systems enable a programmer to easily write concurrent data structures such as lists, trees, hashtables, and graphs, where nonconflicting operations proceed in parallel. Many of these structures take the abstract form of a dictionary, in which each transaction is associated with a search key. By regrouping transactions based on their keys, one may improve locality and reduce conflicts among parallel transactions.In this paper, we present an executor that partitions transactions among available processors. Our keybased adaptive partitioning monitors incoming transactions, estimates the probability distribution of their keys, and adaptively determines the (usually nonuniform) partitions. By comparing the adaptive partitioning with uniform partitioning and round-robin keyless partitioning on a 16-processor SunFire 6800 machine, we demonstrate that key-based adaptive partitioning significantly improves the throughput of finegrained parallel operations on concurrent data structures.",

    "abstract": "Limiting the amount of memory available to a program can hamstring its performance, however in a garbage collected environment allowing too large of a heap size can also be detrimental. Because garbage collection will occasionally access the entire heap, having a significant amount of virtual memory becomes expensive. Determining the appropriate size for a program's heap is not only important, but difficult in light of various virtual machines, operating systems, and levels of multi-programming with which the program may be run. We present a model for program memory usage with which we can show how effective multi-programming is likely to be. In addition, we present an automated system for adding control at the program level that allows runtime adaptation of a program's heap size. The process is fully automatic and requires no extra coding on the part of programmers. We discuss two adaptive schemes: The first acts independently, and while performing competitively, system behaves politely in a multi-programmed environment. The second scheme explicitly cooperates when multiple instances are running. Both schemes are evaluated in terms of their response time, throughput, and fairness.",

    "title": "Locality Approximation Using Time",
    "abstract": "Locality, characterized by data reuses, determines caching performance. Reuse distance (ie LRU stack distance) precisely characterizes program locality and has been used in memory-related research since 1970s. However, the high cost of measuring it still urges a breakthrough before its practical uses in performance debugging, locality analysis and optimizations of long-running applications. In this work, we improve the ef ciency by exploring the connection between time and locality. We propose a statistical model converting cheap time distance to costly reuse distance. Compared to the state-of-the-art technique, this approach reduces measuring time by 17 times, and approximates cache line reuses with over 99% accuracy. Experiments demonstrate the effective uses of the approximated reuse distance in cache miss rate prediction. This work, for the rst time, reveals the strong correlations between time and locality. It makes precise locality as easy to obtain as data access frequency, removes the obstacles to reuse distance's practical uses, and opens new opportunities for program optimizations.",

With the support of this grant, we \u00ef\u00ac rst designed training-based prediction, which accurately predicts the memory performance of large applications before their execution.

We have developed a new technique, which uses reuse distance information from training inputs then extracts a parameterized model of the program's cache miss rates for any input size and for any size of fully associative cache. Using the model we have built a web-based tool using three dimensional visualization. The new model can help to build cost-effective computer systems, design better benchmark suites, and improve task scheduling on heterogeneous systems. The second component is global computation for improving cache performance. We have developed an algorithm for dynamic data partitioning using sampling theory and probability distribution.

Given a program trace, the model divides program data into hierarchical partitions (called affinity groups) based on a parameter , which specifies the number of distinct data elements between accesses to members of each affinity group. Trivial solutions exist for the two ends of the hierarchy. At the top, when  is no less than the data size, all program data belong to one affinity group. At the bottom, when  is 0, each element is an affinity group. We present two theoretical results. The first is the complexity. We show that finding and checking affinity groups are in P when  and . When , the checking problem is NP-complete, and the finding problem is NP-hard. The second is the uses. We show that reference affinity captures the hierarchical data locality from the trace of a hierarchical computation. As additional evidence, we cite empirical results for general-purpose programs.",

In this paper, we use the notion of reuse distance and reuse signature to measure the variation of data locality across program inputs. We use two classes of programs. The first is integer programs from SPEC 2000 benchmark set, including Vpr, Mcf, Parser, Perl, Gzip, and Bzip. For this set we test the current version from their open-source web sites instead of (or in addition to) the ones in the benchmark set. The second class is commonly used interactive programs, including Latex, Ghostview, and Gnuplot. We compare the reuse signature of 126 inputs for these 9 programs and show different degrees of locality variation. For most programs, the reuse signature is mostly consistent across inputs, indicating that the reuse pattern can be exploited in system design and optimization.",

    "title": "Predicting Hierarchical Phases in Program Data Behavior",
    "abstract": "Computer memory hierarchy becomes increasingly powerful but also more complex to optimize. Run-time adaptation emerges as a promising strategy. For software, it means adjusting data behavior at different phases of an execution. For hardware, it means recon-figuring the memory system at different times. This paper presents a method that predicts the memory phases of a program when it runs. The analysis first detects memory phases in a profiling run using variable-distance sampling, wavelet filtering, and optimal phase partition. It then identifies the phase hierarchy through grammar compression. Finally, it inserts phase markers into a program through binary rewriting. The technique is a unique combination of locality profiling and phase prediction. The new method is tested on a wide range of programs against programmer manual analysis and pure hardware monitoring. It predicts program executions that are thousands of times longer than profiling runs. The average length of the predicted phases is over 700 million instructions, and the length is predicted with 99.5% accuracy. When tested for cache adaptation, it reduces the cache size by 40% without increasing the number of cache misses. These results suggest that phase prediction can significantly improve the many adaptation techniques now used for increasing performance, reducing energy, and other improvements to the computer system design.",

    "abstract": "To take advantage of recent architectural improvements in microprocessors, advanced compiler optimizations such as software pipelining have been developed [3, 15, 17, 19, 24]. Unfortunately, not all loops have enough parallelism in the innermost loop body to take advantage of all of the resources a machine provides. Parallelism is normally inhibited by either inner-loop recurrences, or by a mismatch between the resource requirements of a loop and the resources provided by the target architecture. Unroll-and-jam is a transformation that can be used to increase the amount of parallelism in the innermost loop body by making better use of resources and limiting the effects of recurrences [6, 9]. In this paper, we demonstrate how unroll-and-jam can significantly improve the initiation interval in a software-pipelined loop.

It promises more powerful cache optimization than what is possible with existing cache designs but also introduces the problem of multi-level cache programming.",

    "title": "First-passage probability estimation of stochastic dynamic systems by a parametric approach",
    "abstract": "First-passage probability estimation of stochastic dynamic systems is an important but still challenging problem in various science and engineering fields. This paper proposes a novel parametric approach, termed \u2018fractional moments-based mixture distribution\u2019(FMs-MD), to address this challenge. Such method is based on capturing the extreme value distribution (EVD) of the studied stochastic system response in the first place. The concept of FM is then introduced to characterize the EVD, which is by definition a multi-(high-) dimensional integration. To efficiently evaluate the FM, a parallel adaptive strategy is developed by applying a sequential sampling technique, namely, refined Latinized stratified sampling (RLSS). By taking advantage of RLSS, both variance-reduction and parallel computing are possible in the process of FM computation. From the knowledge of low-order FMs, the EVD is then intended to be reconstructed. One flexible MD model is proposed on the basis of the extended Lognormal and generalized inverse Gaussian distributions. By fitting a set of FMs, the EVD can be reconstructed via this mixture model. The performance of the proposed method is verified by a numerical example consisting of a Duffing oscillator with random parameters under Gaussian white noise.",

Most quantitative notions of spatial locality are based on the overall miss rate and leave three questions not fully answered: how much can the locality of a given data layout be improved, can a data layout be improved if the miss rate cannot be lowered, and can the overall spatial locality be decomposed into finer components? This paper describes a new definition of spatial locality that addresses these questions. The model is based on online profiling and off-line analysis. It has been used to analyze 7 SPEC2000 benchmarks and 1 SPEC2006 benchmarks. Among their 18 components, it finds 5 components that have a significant problem of poor spatial locality.",

    "title": "Distributed Speculative Program Parallelization",
    "abstract": "Most computing users today have access to clusters of multi-core computers. To fully utilize a cluster, a programmer must combine two levels of parallelism: shared-memory parallelism within a machine and distributed memory parallelism across machines. Such programming is difficult. Either a user has to mix two programming languages in a single program and use fixed computation and data partitioning between the two, or the user has to rewrite a program from scratch. Even after careful programming, a program may still have hidden concurrency bugs. Users who are accustomed to sequential programming do not find the same level of debugging and performance analysis support especially for a distributed environment.In this paper we present a distributed parallelization system named D-BOP, which enables software speculative parallelization to cross multiple machines. D-BOP provides the same guarantee of preserving the outputs of the original sequential program as some of the shared memory speculative parallelization systems do. The execution of a D-BOP parallelized program is data race free, deadlock free and deterministic.",

The narrower input domain increases the the number of runtime invariants and hence exposes more runtime redundancies. Program specialization improves program performance by eliminating the runtime redundancies. However, the types of invariants that traditional specialization methods can make use of are extremely limited, typically scalar variables. I propose a set of new techniques, spanning from compiler and profile analysis to specialization transformation, to extend the capability of program specialization so that it can utilize the invariance hidden in complex data structures. In the second half of the proposal I intend to measure the similarity between runtime function instances.

Delta-receive, previously known as early release, overlaps data receive and data use.

However, measuring cache performance for one or two data input sets provides no insight into how cache behavior varies across all data input sets. This paper uses our recently published locality analysis to generate a parameterized model of the cache behavior for a program. Given a cache size and associativity, this model predicts the miss rate for arbitrary data input set sizes. This model also identifies critical data input sizes where cache behavior exhibits marked changes. Experiments show that our modeling technique is within 2% of the hit rate for set associative caches on a set of integer and floating-point programs.",

    "abstract": "Profiling can accurately analyze program behavior for select data inputs. This article shows that profiling can also predict program locality for inputs other than profiled ones. Here locality is defined by the distance of data reuse. The article describes three distance-based techniques for whole-program locality analysis. The first is approximate measurement of reuse distance in near linear time. It can measure the reuse distance of all accesses to all data elements in fullsize benchmarks with guaranteed precision. The second is pattern recognition. Based on a few training runs, it classifies patterns as regular and irregular and, for regular ones, it predicts their (changing) behavior for other inputs. It uses regression and multi-model analysis to reduce the prediction error, the space overhead, and the size of the training runs. The last technique is online prediction, which uses distance-based sampling at the beginning of an execution to estimate the locality of the whole execution. When tested on 15 integer and floating-point programs from SPEC and other benchmark suites, these techniques predict with on average 94% accuracy for data inputs up to hundreds times larger than the training inputs. Distance-based locality analysis has been used in measuring and improving the cache performance of a wide range of programs.",

The image is all data decompositions. The mapping takes a program to its hierarchical data placement; a uniform address space to a data hierarchy; and sequences in time to structures in space. In general, the optimal data placement problem is an NP-hard problem [1]. However, there are specialized data placement methods designed for important applications such as matrix operations, N-body simulation and search trees. A question arises naturally: can we find the data placement methods automatically? We propose to use reference affinity to solve this problem. Reference affinity measures whether a group of data is always accessed together during an execution. It gives a unique and hierarchical partition of the data [3].",

We collect an Audio-Visual Event (AVE) dataset to systemically investigate three temporal localization tasks: supervised and weakly-supervised audio-visual event localization, and cross-modality localization. We develop an audio-guided visual attention mechanism to explore audio-visual correlations, propose a dual multimodal residual network (DMRN) to fuse information over the two modalities, and introduce an audio-visual distance learning network to handle the cross-modality localization. Our experiments support the following findings: joint modeling of auditory and visual modalities outperforms independent modeling, the learned attention can capture semantics of sounding objects, temporal alignment is important for audio-visual fusion, the proposed DMRN is effective in fusing audio-visual features, and strong correlations between the two modalities enable cross-modality localization.",

Instead of learning a direct mapping from audio to video frames, we propose first to transfer audio to high-level structure, ie, the facial landmarks, and then to generate video frames conditioned on the landmarks. Compared to a direct audio-to-image approach, our cascade approach avoids fitting spurious correlations between audiovisual signals that are irrelevant to the speech content. We, humans, are sensitive to temporal discontinuities and subtle artifacts in video. To avoid those pixel jittering problems and to enforce the network to focus on audiovisual-correlated regions, we propose a novel dynamically adjustable pixel-wise loss with an attention mechanism. Furthermore, to generate a sharper image with well-synchronized facial movements, we propose a novel regression-based discriminator structure, which considers sequence-level information along with frame-level information. Thoughtful experiments on several datasets and real-world samples demonstrate significantly better results obtained by our method than the state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative comparisons.",

In this paper, we consider a task of such: given an arbitrary audio speech and one lip image of arbitrary target identity, generate synthesized lip movements of the target identity saying the speech. To perform well in this task, it inevitably requires a model to not only consider the retention of target identity, photo-realistic of synthesized images, consistency and smoothness of lip images in a sequence, but more importantly, learn the correlations between audio speech and lip movements. To solve the collective problems, we explore the best modeling of the audio-visual correlations in building and training a lip-movement generator network. Specifically, we devise a method to fuse audio and image embeddings to generate multiple lip images at once and propose a novel correlation loss to synchronize lip changes and speech changes. Our final model utilizes a combination of four losses for a comprehensive consideration in generating lip movements; it is trained in an end-to-end fashion and is robust to lip shapes, view angles and different facial characteristics. Thoughtful experiments on three datasets ranging from lab-recorded to lips in the wild show that our model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods extended to this task.",

When defining the likelihood model, the proposed method models both spectral peaks and non-peak regions (frequencies further than a musical quarter tone from all observed peaks). It is shown that the peak likelihood and the non-peak region likelihood act as a complementary pair. The former helps find F0s that have harmonics that explain peaks, while the latter helps avoid F0s that have harmonics in non-peak regions. Parameters of these models are learned from monophonic and polyphonic training data. This paper proposes an iterative greedy search strategy to estimate F0s one by one, to avoid the combinatorial problem of concurrent F0 estimation. It also \u2026",

    "abstract": "Human voices can be used to authenticate the identity of the speaker, but the automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems are vulnerable to voice spoofing attacks, such as impersonation, replay, text-to-speech, and voice conversion. Recently, researchers developed anti-spoofing techniques to improve the reliability of ASV systems against spoofing attacks. However, most methods encounter difficulties in detecting unknown attacks in practical use, which often have different statistical distributions from known attacks. Especially, the fast development of synthetic voice spoofing algorithms is generating increasingly powerful attacks, putting the ASV systems at risk of unseen attacks. In this work, we propose an anti-spoofing system to detect unknown synthetic voice spoofing attacks (i.e., text-to-speech or voice conversion) using one-class learning.

In these cases, we need to perform semi-supervised source separation and learn a dictionary for that source during the separation process.

The key of this algorithm is the well-functioning reward model. Instead of defining it using music composition rules, we learn this model from monophonic and polyphonic training data. This model considers the compatibility of the machine-generated note with both the machine-generated context and the human-generated context.

Built upon our previous research work on improving the robustness of the SSD systems to channel effects, we propose a channel-robust synthetic speech detection system for the challenge. To mitigate the channel variability issue, we use an acoustic simulator to apply transmission codec, compression codec, and convolutional impulse responses to augmenting the original datasets.

    "title": "Context-dependent piano music transcription with convolutional sparse coding",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to automatic transcription of piano music in a context-dependent setting. This approach employs convolutional sparse coding to approximate the music waveform as the summation of piano note waveforms (dictionary elements) convolved with their temporal activations (onset transcription). The piano note waveforms are pre-recorded for the specific piano to be transcribed in the specific environment. During transcription, the note waveforms are fixed and their temporal activations are estimated and post-processed to obtain the pitch and onset transcription. This approach works in the time domain, models temporal evolution of piano notes, and estimates pitches and onsets simultaneously in the same framework. Experiments show that it significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art music transcription method trained in the same context-dependent setting, in both transcription \u2026",

    "title": "Transcribing human piano performances into music notation",
    "abstract": "Automatic music transcription aims to transcribe musical performances into music notation. However, existing transcription systems that have been described in research papers typically focus on multi-F0 estimation from audio and only output notes in absolute terms, showing frequency and absolute time (a piano-roll representation), but not in musical terms, with spelling distinctions (eg, A\u266d versus G\u266f) and quantized meter. To complete the transcription process, one would need to convert the piano-roll representation into a properly formatted and musically meaningful musical score. This process is non-trivial and largely unresearched. In this paper we present a system that generates music notation output from human-recorded MIDI performances of piano music. We show that the correct estimation of the meter, harmony and streams in a piano performance provides a solid foundation to produce a properly formatted score. In a blind evaluation by professional music theorists, the proposed method outperforms two commercial programs and an open source program in terms of pitch notation and rhythmic notation, and ties for the top in terms of overall voicing and staff placement.",

Recent studies have shown that speech contains rich information about emotion, and numerous speech-based emotion classification methods have been proposed. However, the classification performance is still short of what is desired for the algorithms to be used in real systems. We present an emotion classification system using several one-against-all support vector machines with a thresholding fusion mechanism to combine the individual outputs, which provides the functionality to effectively increase the emotion classification accuracy at the expense of rejecting some samples as unclassified.

In practice, however, acoustic condition variability in speech utterances may significantly degrade the performance of CM systems. In this paper, we conduct a cross-dataset study on several state-of-the-art CM systems and observe significant performance degradation compared with their single-dataset performance. Observing differences of average magnitude spectra of bona fide utterances across the datasets, we hypothesize that channel mismatch among these datasets is one important reason. We then verify it by demonstrating a similar degradation of CM systems trained on original but evaluated on channel-shifted data. Finally, we propose several channel robust strategies (data augmentation, multi-task learning, adversarial learning) for CM systems, and observe a significant performance improvement on cross-dataset experiments.",

The system consists of two stages: multi-pitch estimation and pitch trajectory formation. In the first stage, we propose a new approach based on modeling spectral peaks and non-peak regions to estimate pitches and polyphony in each single frame. In the second stage, we view the pitch trajectory formation problem as a constrained clustering problem of pitch estimates in all the frames. Constraints are imposed on some pairs of pitch estimates, according to time and frequency proximity. In clustering, harmonic structure is employed as the feature. The proposed system is tested on 10 recorded four-part JS Bach chorales. Both multi-pitch estimation and tracking results are very promising. In addition, for multi-pitch estimation, the proposed system is shown to outperform a state-of-the-art multi-pitch estimation approach.",

We present Vocal Imitation Set, a new vocal imitation dataset containing 11, 242 crowd-sourced vocal imitations of 302 sound event classes in the AudioSet sound event ontology. It is the largest publicly-available dataset of vocal imitations as well as the first to adopt the widely-used AudioSet ontology for a vocal imitation dataset.

Vocal Imitation Set also has an average of 10 different original recordings per sound class. Since each sound class has about 19 listener-vetted imitations and 10 original sound files, the data set is suited for training models to do fine-grained vocal imitation-based search within sound classes.

In this paper, we propose an edit distance, similar to the Levenshtein Distance used for measuring the difference between two sequences, typically strings of characters. The metric treats a music score as a sequence of sets of musical objects, ordered by their onsets. The metric reports the differences between two music scores based on twelve aspects: barlines, clefs, key signatures, time signatures, notes, note spelling, note durations, stem directions, groupings, rests, rest duration, and staff assignment. We also apply a linear regression model to the metric in order to predict human evaluations on a dataset of short music excerpts automatically transcribed into music notation.",

The model adaptation method needs to access the musical score content for each instrument, which is provided by an online audio-score alignment method.

These features are then processed by squeeze-and-excitation blocks, a multi-level feature aggregator, and a time delayed neural network (TDNN) to compute speaker embedding. We show that the proposed embeddings outperform existing raw-waveform-based speaker embeddings on speaker verification by a large margin. A further analysis of the learned filters shows that the multi-scale encoder attends to different frequency bands at its different scales while resulting in a more flat overall frequency response than any of the single-scale counterparts.",

    "title": "Note-level Music Transcription by Maximum Likelihood Sampling.",
    "abstract": "Note-level music transcription, which aims to transcribe note events (often represented by pitch, onset and offset times) from music audio, is an important intermediate step towards complete music transcription. In this paper, we present a note-level music transcription system, which is built on a state-of-the-art frame-level multi-pitch estimation (MPE) system. Preliminary note-level transcription achieved by connecting pitch estimates into notes often lead to many spurious notes due to MPE errors. In this paper, we propose to address this problem by randomly sampling notes in the preliminary note-level transcription. Each sample is a subset of all notes and is viewed as a notelevel transcription candidate. We evaluate the likelihood of each candidate using the MPE model, and select the one with the highest likelihood as the final transcription. The likelihood treats notes in a transcription as a whole and favors transcriptions with less spurious notes. Experiments conducted on 110 pieces of JS Bach chorales with polyphony from 2 to 4 show that the proposed sampling scheme significantly improves the transcription performance from the preliminary approach. The proposed system also significantly outperforms two other state-of-the-art systems in both frame-level and note-level transcriptions.",

This system allows users to search sounds even if they do not remember their semantic labels or the sounds do not have these labels (e.g., synthesized sound effects). IMISOUND employs a Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) to extract features from both the vocal imitation (query) and sounds in the library (candidates). The SAE is pre-trained using training vocal imitations of sounds not in the library to automatically learn more suitable feature representations than human-engineered features such as MFCC's.

Different from ordinary cepstrum and MFCC which have to be calculated from the full magnitude spectrum of a source after source separation, UDC can be calculated directly from isolated spectral points that are likely to belong to the source in the mixture spectrum (e.g., non-overlapping harmonics of a harmonic source). Existing cepstral representations that have this property are discrete cepstrum and regularized discrete cepstrum, however, compared to the proposed UDC, they are not as effective and are more complex to compute. The key advantage of UDC is that it uses a more natural and locally adaptive regularizer to prevent it from overfitting the isolated spectral points. We derive the mathematical relations between these cepstral representations, and compare \u2026",

Existing approaches, however, are mostly ad hoc to specific rhythmic structures or instrumentation layouts, and lack music-theoretic rigor in their evaluations. In this paper, we present a neural language (music) model that tries to model symbolic multi-part music. Our model is part-invariant, ie, it can process/generate any part (voice) of a music score consisting of an arbitrary number of parts, using a single trained model. For better incorporating structural information of pitch spaces, we use a structured embedding matrix to encode multiple aspects of a pitch into a vector representation. The generation is performed by Gibbs Sampling. Meanwhile, our model directly generates note spellings to make outputs human-readable. We performed objective (grading) and subjective (listening) evaluations by recruiting music theorists to compare the outputs of our algorithm with those of music students on the task of bassline harmonization (a traditional pedagogical task). Our experiment shows that errors of our algorithm and students are differently distributed, and the range of ratings for generated pieces overlaps with students\u2019 to varying extents for our three provided basslines.

However, due to the scarcity of carefully labeled data, their training process suffers from over-fitting. Data augmentation is a technique that alleviates this issue. It augments the training set with synthetic data that are created by modifying some parameters of the real data. However, not all kinds of augmentations are helpful, and some are in fact harmful for the recognition of certain sound concepts. Figuring out the appropriate augmentations for the appropriate training data is thus an interesting question. In this paper, we propose a framework for data augmentation through metric learning. The idea is to first learn a metric from the original training data, and then use it to filter out augmented data samples that are far from original ones in the same class.

Hand-crafted features may not work well for a large variety of imitations. Instead, we use a stacked auto-encoder to automatically learn features from a set of vocal imitations in an unsupervised way. Then, a multi-class SVM is trained for sound concepts of interest using their training imitations.

A major challenge is caused by unseen attacks empowered by advanced speech synthesis technologies. Our previous research on one-class learning has improved the generalization ability to unseen attacks by compacting the bona fide speech in the embedding space. However, such compactness lacks consideration of the diversity of speakers. In this work, we propose speaker attractor multi-center one-class learning (SAMO), which clusters bona fide speech around a number of speaker attractors and pushes away spoofing attacks from all the attractors in a high-dimensional embedding space. For training, we propose an algorithm for the co-optimization of bona fide speech clustering and bona fide/spoof classification. For inference, we propose strategies to enable anti-spoofing for speakers without enrollment \u2026",

In this paper, we build a probabilistic framework for fusing the ASV and CM subsystem scores. We further propose fusion strategies for direct inference and fine-tuning to predict the SASV score based on the framework. Surprisingly, these strategies significantly improve the SASV equal error rate (EER) from 19.31% of the baseline to 1.53% on the official evaluation trials of the SASV challenge.

    "abstract": "The online estimation of rhythmic information, such as beat positions, downbeat positions, and meter, is critical for many real-time music applications. Musical rhythm comprises complex hierarchical relationships across time, rendering its analysis intrinsically challenging and at times subjective. Furthermore, systems which attempt to estimate rhythmic information in real-time must be causal and must produce estimates quickly and efficiently. In this work, we introduce an online system for joint beat, downbeat, and meter tracking, which utilizes causal convolutional and recurrent layers, followed by a pair of sequential Monte Carlo particle filters applied during inference. The proposed system does not need to be primed with a time signature in order to perform downbeat tracking, and is instead able to estimate meter and adjust the predictions over time. Additionally, we propose an information gate strategy to significantly decrease the computational cost of particle filtering during the inference step, making the system much faster than previous sampling-based methods. Experiments on the GTZAN dataset, which is unseen during training, show that the system outperforms various online beat and downbeat tracking systems and achieves comparable performance to a baseline offline joint method.",

Associating the audio and visual aspects of the same source, or audio-visual source association, is a fundamental problem for audio-visual analysis of polyphonic musical performances. In this paper, we propose an approach to solve this problem for string ensemble performances by analyzing the vibrato patterns. On the audio side, we extract the pitch trajectories of vibrato notes of each string player in a score-informed fashion. On the video side, we track the left hand of string players and capture their fine-grained left-hand vibration due to vibrato. We find a high correlation between the pitch fluctuation and the hand vibration for vibrato notes, and use this correlation to associate the audio and visual aspects of the same players. This work is a complementary extension to our previous work on source association for string ensembles based on bowing motion analysis. Experiments on 19 pieces of chamber musical performances with at most one non-string instrument show more accurate and robust association performance than our previous method.",

Today, however, there is a lack of improvisation culture in classical music performance and education; classical musicians either are not trained to improvise, or cannot find other people to improvise with. Motivated by this observation, we develop BachDuet, a system that enables real-time counterpoint improvisation between a human and a machine. This system uses a recurrent neural network to process the human musician\u2019s monophonic performance on a MIDI keyboard and generates the machine\u2019s monophonic performance in real time. We develop a GUI to visualize the generated music content and to facilitate this interaction. We conduct user studies with 13 musically trained users and show the feasibility of two-party duet counterpoint improvisation and the effectiveness of BachDuet for this purpose. We also conduct listening tests with 48 participants and show that they cannot tell the difference between duets generated by human-machine improvisation using BachDuet and those generated by human-human improvisation. Objective evaluation is also conducted to assess the degree to which these improvisations adhere to common rules of counterpoint, showing promising results.",

    "title": "Aligning Semi-Improvised Music Audio with Its Lead Sheet",
    "abstract": "Existing audio-score alignment methods assume that the audio performance is faithful to a fully-notated MIDI score. For semi-improvised music (eg jazz), this assumption is strongly violated. In this paper, we address the problem of aligning semi-improvised music audio with a lead sheet. Our approach does not require prior training on performances of the lead sheet to be aligned. We start by analyzing the problem and propose to represent the lead sheet as a MIDI file together with a structural information file. Then we propose a dynamic-programming-based system to align the chromagram representations of the audio performance and the MIDI score. Techniques are proposed to address the chromagram scaling, key transposition and structural change (eg a performer unexpectedly repeats a section) problems. We test our system on 3 jazz lead sheets. For each sheet we align a set of solo piano performances and a set of fullband commercial recordings with different instrumentation and styles. Results show that our system achieves promising results on some highly improvised music.",

    "title": "Skipping the Frame-Level: Event-Based Piano Transcription With Neural Semi-CRFs",
    "abstract": "Piano transcription systems are typically optimized to estimate pitch activity at each frame of audio. They are often followed by carefully designed heuristics and post-processing algorithms to estimate note events from the frame-level predictions. Recent methods have also framed piano transcription as a multi-task learning problem, where the activation of different stages of a note event are estimated independently. These practices are not well aligned with the desired outcome of the task, which is the specification of note intervals as holistic events, rather than the aggregation of disjoint observations. In this work, we propose a novel formulation of piano transcription, which is optimized to directly predict note events. Our method is based on Semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields (semi-CRF), which produce scores for intervals rather than individual frames. When formulating piano transcription in this way, we eliminate the need to rely on disjoint frame-level estimates for different stages of a note event. We conduct experiments on the MAESTRO dataset and demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses the current state-of-the-art for piano transcription. Our results suggest that the semi-CRF output layer, while still quadratic in complexity, is a simple, fast and well-performing solution for event-based prediction, and may lead to similar success in other areas which currently rely on frame-level estimates.",

The personalized HRTFs show significant improvement upon the finite element acoustic computations of HRTFs provided in the HUTUBS database.",

    "abstract": "Counterpoint is an important concept in Western music theory. In the past century, there have been significant interests in incorporating counterpoint into Chinese folk music composition. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based system, named FolkDuet, towards the online countermelody generation for Chinese folk melodies. With no existing data of Chinese folk duets, FolkDuet employs two reward models based on out-of-domain data, ie Bach chorales, and monophonic Chinese folk melodies. An interaction reward model is trained on the duets formed from outer parts of Bach chorales to model counterpoint interaction, while a style reward model is trained on monophonic melodies of Chinese folk songs to model melodic patterns. With both rewards, the generator of FolkDuet is trained to generate countermelodies while maintaining the Chinese folk style. The entire generation process is performed in an online fashion, allowing real-time interactive human-machine duet improvisation. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves better subjective and objective results than the baselines.",

    "abstract": "Modeling the dynamics of a moving human face/body conditioned on another modality is a fundamental problem in computer vision, where applications are ranging from audio-to-video generation [3] to text-to-video generation and to skeleton-to-image/video generation [7]. This paper considers such a task: given a target face image and an arbitrary speech audio recording, generating a photo-realistic talking face of the target subject saying that speech with natural lip synchronization while maintaining a smooth transition of facial images over time (see Fig. 1). Note that the model should have a robust generalization capability to different types of faces (eg, cartoon faces, animal faces) and to noisy speech conditions. Solving this task is crucial to enabling many applications, eg, lip-reading from over-thephone audio for hearing-impaired people, generating virtual characters with synchronized facial movements to speech audio for movies and games. The main difference between still image generation and video generation is temporal-dependency modeling. There are two main reasons why it imposes additional challenges: people are sensitive to any pixel jittering (eg, temporal discontinuities and subtle artifacts) in a video; they are also sensitive to slight misalignment between facial movements and speech audio. However, recent researchers [3, 2] tended to formulate video generation as a temporally independent image generation problem. In this paper, we propose a novel temporal GAN structure, which consists of a multi-modal convolutional-RNN-based (MMCRNN) generator and a novel regression-based discriminator structure.

Isolated recording also allows rebalancing of levels between musicians without re-recording and application of audio effects to individual instruments. Many of these techniques require (nearly) isolated instrumental recordings to work. Unfortunately, there are many recording situations (e.\u202fg., a stereo recording of a 10-piece ensemble) where there are many more instruments than there are microphones, making many editing or remixing tasks difficult or impossible.Audio source separation is the process of extracting individual sound sources (e.\u202fg., a single flute) from a mixture of sounds (e.\u202fg., a recording of a concert band using a single microphone). Effective source separation would allow application of editing and remixing \u2026",

    "abstract": "Given a set of monophonic, harmonic sound sources (e.g. human voices or wind instruments), multi-pitch estimation (MPE) is the task of determining the instantaneous pitches of each source. Multi-pitch tracking (MPT) connects the instantaneous pitch estimates provided by MPE algorithms into pitch trajectories of sources. A trajectory can be short (within a musical note), or long (an entire piece of music). While note-level MPT methods usually utilize local time-frequency proximity of pitches to connect them into a note, song-level MPT is much more difficult and needs more information. This is because pitches evolve discontinuously from note to note, and pitch trajectories can even interweave. In this paper, we cast the song-level MPT problem as a constrained clustering problem. The constraints are time-frequency locality of pitches and the clustering objective is their timbre consistency. Due to this problem's unique \u2026",

    "title": "Singing voice separation by low-rank and sparse spectrogram decomposition with prelearned dictionaries",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised spectrogram decomposition has shown promising results for singing voice separation in recent years. Its basic idea is to decompose the mixture spectrogram into a sparse spectrogram for the singing voice and a low-rank spectrogram for the background music. This approach, however, has two limitations. First, the unsupervised nature prevents the pre-learning of voice and background music dictionaries from widely available, although not related to the song being separated, isolated singing voice and background music recordings. Second, some components of the singing voice (eg, fricatives) and the background music (eg, less repetitive background) may not show the preferred sparse and low-rank properties, respectively. In this paper we propose to decompose the mixture spectrogram into three parts: a sparse spectrogram representing the singing voice, a low-rank spectrogram representing the background music, and a residual spectrogram for the components that are not identified by either the sparse or the low-rank spectrogram. Besides, we learn universal voice and music dictionaries from isolated singing voice and background music training data. Finally, we propose an approach named Low-rank and Sparse representation with Pre-learned Dictionaries under the framework of Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier. Experiments on the MIR-1K dataset and iKala dataset show its better performance.",

This is challenging for approaches based on audio alone due to the polyphonic nature of the audio signals. Video of the performance, when available, can be useful to alleviate some of the difficulties. In this paper, we propose to detect the play/non-play (P/NP) activities from musical performance videos using optical flow analysis to help with audio-based multi-pitch analysis. Specifically, the detected P/NP activity provides a more accurate estimate of the instantaneous polyphony (i.e., the number of pitches at a time instant), and also helps with assigning pitch estimates to only active sound sources.

    "abstract": "One challenge in score following for piano music is the sustained effect, i.e., the waveform of a note lasts longer than what is notated in the score. This can be caused by expressive performing styles such as the legato articulation and the usage of the sustain and the sostenuto pedals and can also be caused by the reverberation in the recording environment. This effect creates nonnotated overlappings between sustained notes and latter notes in the audio. It decreases the audio-score alignment accuracy and robustness of score following systems and makes them be prone to delay errors, i.e., aligning audio to a score position that is earlier than the correct position. In this paper, we propose to modify the feature representation of the audio to attenuate the sustained effect. We show that this idea can be applied to both the chromagram and the spectral-peak representations, which are commonly used in score \u2026",

Instead of learning a direct mapping from audio to video frames, we propose first to transfer audio to high-level structure, i.e., the facial landmarks, and then to generate video frames conditioned on the landmarks. Compared to a direct audio-to-image approach, our cascade approach avoids fitting spurious correlations between audiovisual signals that are irrelevant to the speech content. We, humans, are sensitive to temporal discontinuities and subtle artifacts in video. To avoid those pixel jittering problems and to enforce the network to focus on audiovisual-correlated regions, we propose a novel dynamically adjustable pixel-wise loss with an attention mechanism. Furthermore, to generate a sharper image with well-synchronized facial movements, we propose a novel regression-based discriminator structure, which considers sequence-level information along with frame-level information. Thoughtful experiments on several datasets and real-world samples demonstrate significantly better results obtained by our method than the state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative comparisons.",

In this paper, we first leverage flow-based generators to train individual music source priors and then use these models, along with likelihood-based objectives, to separate music mixtures. We show that in singing voice separation and music separation tasks, our proposed method is competitive with a fully-supervised approach. We also demonstrate that we can flexibly add new types of sources, whereas fully-supervised approaches would require retraining of the entire model.",

We pose and seek to answer the following questions:(Q1) Does inference jointly over auditory and visual modalities outperform inference over them independently?(Q2) How does the result vary under noisy training conditions?(Q3) How does knowing one modality help model the other modality?(Q4) How do we best fuse information over both modalities?(Q5) Can we locate the content in one modality given its observation in the other modality? Notice that the individual questions might be studied in the literature, but we are not aware of any work that conducts a systematic study to answer these collective questions as a whole.In particular, we define an audio-visual event as an event that is both visible and audible in a video segment, and we establish three tasks to explore aforementioned research questions: 1) supervised audio-visual event localization, 2) weakly-supervised audio-visual event localization, and 3) event-agnostic cross-modality localization. The first two tasks aim to predict which temporal segment of an input video has an audio-visual event and what category the event belongs to. The weakly-supervised setting assumes that we have no access to the temporal event boundary but an event tag at video-level for training. Q1-Q4 will be explored within these two tasks. In the third task, we aim to locate the corresponding visual sound source temporally within a video from a given sound segment and vice versa, which will answer Q5.",

    "title": "WISE: Web-based Interactive Speech Emotion Classification.",
    "abstract": "The ability to classify emotions from speech is beneficial in a number of domains, including the study of human relationships. However, manual classification of emotions from speech is time consuming. Current technology supports the automatic classification of emotions from speech, but these systems have some limitations. In particular, existing systems are trained with a given data set and cannot adapt to new data nor can they adapt to different users\u2019 notions of emotions. In this study, we introduce WISE, a web-based interactive speech emotion classification system. WISE has a web-based interface that allows users to upload speech data and automatically classify the emotions within this speech using pre-trained models. The user can then adjust the emotion label if the system classification of the emotion does not agree with the user\u2019s perception, and this updated label is then fed back into the system to retrain the models. In this way, WISE enables the emotion classification models to be adapted over time. We evaluate WISE by simulating the user interactions with the system using the LDC dataset, which has known, ground-truth labels. We evaluate the benefit of the user feedback enabled by WISE in situations where manually classifying emotions in a large dataset is costly, yet trained models alone will not be able to accurately classify the data.",

    "title": "Score following for piano performances with sustain-pedal effects",
    "abstract": "One challenge in score following (ie, mapping audio frames to score positions in real time) for piano performances is the mismatch between audio and score caused by the usage of the sustain pedal. When the pedal is pressed, notes played will continue to sound until the string vibration naturally ceases. This makes the notes longer than their notated lengths and overlap with later notes. In this paper, we propose an approach to address this problem. Given that the most competitive wrong score positions for each audio frame are the ones before the correct position due to the sustained sounds, we remove partials of sustained notes and only retain partials of \u201cnew notes\u201d in the audio representation. This operation reduces sustain-pedal effects by weakening the match between the audio frame and previous wrong score positions, hence encourages the system to align to the correct score position. We implement this idea based on a state-of-the-art score following framework. Experiments on synthetic and real piano performances from the MAPS dataset show significant improvements on both alignment accuracy and robustness.",

They aim to detect which speakers or none are talking in a visual scene at any given time. Existing research on ASD does not agree on the definition of active speakers. We clarify the definition in this work and require synchronization between the audio and visual speaking activities. This clarification of definition is motivated by our extensive experiments, through which we discover that existing ASD methods fail in modeling the audio-visual synchronization and often classify unsynchronized videos as active speaking. To address this problem, we propose a cross-modal contrastive learning strategy and apply positional encoding in attention modules for supervised ASD models to leverage the synchronization cue.

They are widely used in spatial audio rendering. While the azimuth and elevation angles are intrinsically continuous, measured HRTFs in existing datasets employ different spatial sampling schemes, making it difficult to model HRTFs across datasets. In this work, we propose to use neural fields, a differentiable representation of functions through neural networks, to model HRTFs with arbitrary spatial sampling schemes. Such representation is unified across datasets with different spatial sampling schemes. HRTFs for arbitrary azimuth and elevation angles can be derived from this representation.

    "abstract": "Guitar tablature transcription is an important but understudied problem within the field of music information retrieval. Traditional signal processing approaches offer only limited performance on the task, and there is little acoustic data with transcription labels for training machine learning models. However, guitar transcription labels alone are more widely available in the form of tablature, which is commonly shared among guitarists online. In this work, a collection of symbolic tablature is leveraged to estimate the pairwise likelihood of notes on the guitar. The output layer of a baseline tablature transcription model is reformulated, such that an inhibition loss can be incorporated to discourage the co-activation of unlikely note pairs. This naturally enforces playability constraints for guitar, and yields tablature which is more consistent with the symbolic data used to estimate pairwise likelihoods. With this methodology, we show that symbolic tablature can be used to shape the distribution of a tablature transcription model's predictions, even when little acoustic data is available.",

Beyond timbre transfer, achieving controllability on para-linguistic parameters such as pitch and Speed is critical in deploying VC systems in many application scenarios. Existing studies, however, either only provide utterance-level global control or lack interpretability on the controls. In this paper, we propose ControlVC, the first neural voice conversion system that achieves time-varying controls on pitch and speed. ControlVC uses pre-trained encoders to compute pitch and linguistic embeddings from the source utterance and speaker embeddings from the target utterance. These embeddings are then concatenated and converted to speech using a vocoder. It achieves speed control through TD-PSOLA pre-processing on the source utterance, and achieves pitch control by manipulating the pitch contour before feeding it to the pitch encoder. Systematic subjective and objective evaluations are conducted to assess the speech quality and controllability. Results show that, on non-parallel and zero-shot conversion tasks, ControlVC significantly outperforms two other self-constructed baselines on speech quality, and it can successfully achieve time-varying pitch and speed control.",

Its main challenge is the lack of strong rhythmic and harmonic patterns that are important for music rhythmic analysis in general. Even for human listeners, this can be a challenging task. As a result, existing music beat tracking systems fail to deliver satisfactory performance on singing voices. In this paper, we propose singing beat tracking as a novel task, and propose the first approach to solving this task. Our approach leverages semantic information of singing voices by employing pre-trained self-supervised WavLM and DistilHuBERT speech representations as the front-end and uses a self-attention encoder layer to predict beats. To train and test the system, we obtain separated singing voices and their beat annotations using source separation and beat tracking on complete songs, followed by manual corrections. Experiments on the 741 separated vocal tracks of the GTZAN dataset show that the proposed system outperforms several state-of-the-art music beat tracking methods by a large margin in terms of beat tracking accuracy. Ablation studies also confirm the advantages of pre-trained self-supervised speech representations over generic spectral features.",

In this work, we propose an HRTF personalization method employing convolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict a subject's HRTFs for all directions from their scanned head geometry. To ease the training of the CNN models, we propose novel pre-processing methods for both the head scans and HRTF data to achieve compact representations. For the head scan, we use truncated spherical cap harmonic (SCH) coefficients to represent the pinna area, which is important in the acoustic scattering process. For the HRTF data, we use truncated spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients to represent the HRTF magnitudes and onsets. One CNN model is trained to predict the SH coefficients of the HRTF magnitudes from the SCH coefficients of the scanned ear geometry and other anthropometric measurements of the head. The other CNN model is trained to predict SH coefficients of the HRTF onsets from only the anthropometric measurements of the ear, head, and torso. Combining the magnitude and onset predictions, our method is able to predict the complete and global HRTF data. A leave-one-out validation with the log-spectral distortion (LSD) metric is used for objective evaluation. The results show a decent LSD level at both spatial \\& temporal dimensions compared to the ground-truth HRTFs and a lower LSD than the boundary element method (BEM) simulation of HRTFs that the database provides.

Great musicians such as JS Bach, were better known as improvisers than composers. Today, however, there is a lack of improvisation culture in classical music performance and education; classical musicians either do not know how to improvise, or cannot find other people to jam with. Motivated by this observation, we developed BachDuet, a system that enables real-time counterpoint improvisation between a human and a machine. This system uses a recurrent neural network to process the human musician\u2019s monophonic performance on a MIDI keyboard and generates the machine\u2019s monophonic performance in real time. We hope that it will serve as both an entertainment and practice tool for classical musicians to develop their improvisation skills.Proposed System. We design this system to support two kinds of human-machine music improvisation: a) free counterpoint improvisation in a duet setting and b) conditional counterpoint improvisation in a duet setting over a given bass part. In both settings, the system predicts the next note of the machine\u2019s voice based on the past notes of both the machine\u2019s and the human\u2019s voices, as well as the pre-defined bass part in the second setting (Figure 1). This causal way of music generation allows us to implement this system with a real-time GUI, where the user interacts with the system by playing on a MIDI keyboard. The system operates with a preset steady tempo to ensure human-machine synchronization. A demo video can be found here 1.",

It models the music waveform as a summation of piano note waveforms (dictionary elements) convolved with their temporal activations (onsets). The piano note waveforms are pre-recorded in a context-dependent way, i.e., for the specific piano to be transcribed in the specific environment. During \u2026",

    "abstract": "Guitar tablature is a form of music notation widely used among guitarists. It captures not only the musical content of a piece, but also its implementation and ornamentation on the instrument. Guitar Tablature Transcription (GTT) is an important task with broad applications in music education, composition, and entertainment. Existing GTT datasets are quite limited in size and scope, rendering models trained on them prone to overfitting and incapable of generalizing to out-of-domain data. In order to address this issue, we present a methodology for synthesizing large-scale GTT audio using commercial acoustic and electric guitar plugins. We procure SynthTab, a dataset derived from DadaGP, which is a vast and diverse collection of richly annotated symbolic tablature. The proposed synthesis pipeline produces audio which faithfully adheres to the original fingerings and a subset of techniques specified in the tablature \u2026",

    "abstract": "Despite recent improvements in audio-text modeling, audio-text contrastive models still lag behind their image-text counterparts in scale and performance. We propose a method to improve both the scale and the training of audio-text contrastive models. Specifically, we craft a large-scale audio-text dataset consisting of over 13,000 hours of text-labeled audio, aided by large language model (LLM) processing and audio captioning. Further, we employ an masked autoencoder (MAE) pre-pretraining phase with random patch dropout, which allows us to both scale unlabeled audio datasets and train efficiently with variable length audio. After MAE pre-pretraining of our audio encoder, we train a contrastive model with an auxiliary captioning objective. Our final model, which we name Cacophony, achieves state-of-the-art performance on audio-text retrieval tasks, and exhibits competitive results on other downstream tasks such as zero-shot classification.",

Among them, some require real-time processing, such as live performance processing and auto-accompaniment for singing inputs. This task is challenging owing to the non-trivial rhythmic and harmonic patterns in singing signals. For real-time processing, it introduces further constraints such as inaccessibility to future data and the impossibility to correct the previous results that are inconsistent with the latter ones. In this paper, we introduce the first system that tracks the beats and downbeats of singing voices in real-time. Specifically, we propose a novel dynamic particle filtering approach that incorporates offline historical data to correct the online inference by using a variable number of particles.

    "abstract": "Inferring music time structures has a broad range of applications in music production, processing and analysis. Scholars have proposed various methods to analyze different aspects of time structures, such as beat, downbeat, tempo and meter. Many state-of-the-art (SOFA) methods, however, are computationally expensive. This makes them inapplicable in real-world industrial settings where the scale of the music collections can be millions. This paper proposes a new state space and a semi-Markov model for music time structure analysis. The proposed approach turns the commonly used 2D state spaces into a 1D model through a jump-back reward strategy. It reduces the state spaces size drastically. We then utilize the proposed method for causal, joint beat, downbeat, tempo, and meter tracking, and compare it against several previous methods. The proposed method delivers similar performance with the SOFA \u2026",

    "abstract": "Human voices can be used to authenticate the identity of the speaker, but the automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems are vulnerable to voice spoofing attacks, such as impersonation, replay, text-to-speech, and voice conversion. Recently, researchers developed anti-spoofing techniques to improve the reliability of ASV systems against spoofing attacks. However, most methods encounter difficulties in detecting unknown attacks in practical use, which often have different statistical distributions from known attacks. In this work, we propose an anti-spoofing system to detect unknown logical access attacks (ie, synthetic speech) using one-class learning. The key idea is to compact the genuine speech representation and inject an angular margin to separate the spoofing attacks in the embedding space. Our system achieves an equal error rate of 2.19% on the evaluation set of ASVspoof 2019 Challenge \u2026",

Notes in a signal are then isolated using a spectral masking method, based on the average harmonic structure learned from each source. Onset timing is finally estimated by maximizing the time derivative of the energy curve of the note within an observation window. We show that this method significantly improves the onset timing estimation accuracy, measured by both the align rate and onset time deviation, and outperforms a state-of-art reference method.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based audio and music generation models commonly generate music by constructing an image representation of audio (e.g., a mel-spectrogram) and then converting it to audio using a phase reconstruction model or vocoder. Typical vocoders, however, produce monophonic audio at lower resolutions (e.g., 16-24 kHz), which limits their effectiveness. We propose MusicHiFi -- an efficient high-fidelity stereophonic vocoder. Our method employs a cascade of three generative adversarial networks (GANs) that convert low-resolution mel-spectrograms to audio, upsamples to high-resolution audio via bandwidth expansion, and upmixes to stereophonic audio. Compared to previous work, we propose 1) a unified GAN-based generator and discriminator architecture and training procedure for each stage of our cascade, 2) a new fast, near downsampling-compatible bandwidth extension module, and 3) a new fast downmix-compatible mono-to-stereo upmixer that ensures the preservation of monophonic content in the output. We evaluate our approach using both objective and subjective listening tests and find our approach yields comparable or better audio quality, better spatialization control, and significantly faster inference speed compared to past work.

In general, we observe a more significant performance degradation of these raw-waveform systems compared to spectral based systems.

The first strategy is to change the real-valued filters into analytic filters to ensure shift-invariance. The second strategy is to apply variational dropout to non-parametric filters to prevent them from overfitting irrelevant nuance features. By combining these strategies, we achieve results comparable to spectral based systems on both the VoxCeleb and VOiCEs datasets. Futhermore, we demonstrate that the learned filters carry little noise compared to existing non-parametric learnable front-ends.",

Furthermore, systems which attempt to estimate rhythmic information in real-time must be causal and must produce estimates quickly and efficiently. In this work, we introduce an online system for joint beat, downbeat, and meter tracking, which utilizes causal convolutional and recurrent layers, followed by a pair of sequential Monte Carlo particle filters applied during inference. The proposed system does not need to be primed with a time signature in order to perform downbeat tracking, and is instead able to estimate meter and adjust the predictions over time. Additionally, we propose an information gate strategy to significantly decrease the computational cost of particle filtering during the inference step, making the system much faster than previous sampling-based methods. Experiments on the GTZAN dataset, which is unseen during training, show that the system outperforms various online beat and downbeat tracking systems and achieves comparable performance to a baseline offline joint method.",

In this work, several variations of a frontend filterbank learning module are investigated for piano transcription, a challenging low-level music information retrieval task. We build upon a standard piano transcription model, modifying only the feature extraction stage. The filterbank module is designed such that its complex filters are unconstrained 1D convolutional kernels with long receptive fields. Additional variations employ the Hilbert transform to render the filters intrinsically analytic and apply variational dropout to promote filterbank sparsity.

In this paper we find that these algorithms work well when it is run for less than 1 minute, but degradation of the enhanced speech signal starts to appear after 2 minutes.

    "title": "Multi-Pitch Estimation based on Partial Event and Support Transfer",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for the multi-pitch estimation of polyphonic music signals. Instead of on the frame level, the estimation is based on the partial event, which is defined like the note event in MIDI. All partial events in a piece of music are extracted dynamically in the process of the frame by frame short time Fourier transform (STFT). For each event, net support degree received from other events is calculated and the events with the highest support degrees are selected to be the fundamental frequency (FO) events. From another point of view, the support is transferred from higher frequency partial events to lower ones and finally concentrated on the FO events. This method can estimate the number of concurrent sounds, the onset and offset times of the notes. Experiments on both randomly mixed chord signals and synthesized ensemble music signals in \"wav\" format are conducted and the results are promising.",

The frequencies and amplitudes of the spectral peaks are viewed as observations, and the F0s are viewed as parameters to be estimated. The proposed method considers the potential errors in the peak detection algorithm and treats each peak as \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d separately. The likelihood models of the \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d peaks are learned from the monophonic training data, with the assumption that the statistics of the peaks in monophonic and polyphonic signals are similar. The proposed method also incorporates a rectified Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) to estimate the number of the parameters, ie the polyphony. Evaluation is held on randomly mixed chords, which are generated from the previously unseen monophonic tones. Experimental results show the feasibility of this method.",

    "abstract": "Dimensional representations of speech emotions such as the arousal-valence (AV) representation provide a continuous and fine-grained description and control than their categorical counterparts. They have wide applications in tasks such as dynamic emotion understanding and expressive text-to-speech synthesis. Existing methods that predict the dimensional emotion representation from speech cast it as a supervised regression task. These methods face data scarcity issues, as dimensional annotations are much harder to acquire than categorical labels. In this work, we propose to learn the AV representation from categorical emotion labels of speech. We start by learning a rich and emotion-relevant high-dimensional speech feature representation using self-supervised pre-training and emotion classification fine-tuning. This representation is then mapped to the 2D AV space according to psychological findings \u2026",

Supervised learning techniques have demonstrated solid performance on more narrow characterizations of the task, but suffer from limitations concerning the shortage of large-scale and diverse polyphonic music datasets with multi-pitch annotations. We present a suite of self-supervised learning objectives for multi-pitch estimation, which encourage the concentration of support around harmonics, invariance to timbral transformations, and equivariance to geometric transformations. These objectives are sufficient to train an entirely convolutional autoencoder to produce multi-pitch salience-grams directly, without any fine-tuning. Despite training exclusively on a collection of synthetic single-note audio samples, our fully self-supervised framework generalizes to polyphonic music mixtures, and achieves performance comparable to supervised models trained on conventional multi-pitch datasets.",

As the acoustic measurement of HRTFs is resource-intensive, predicting individualized HRTFs using machine learning models is a promising approach at scale. Training such models require a unified HRTF representation across multiple databases to utilize their respectively limited samples. However, in addition to differences on the spatial sampling locations, recent studies have shown that, even for the common location, HRTFs across databases manifest consistent differences that make it trivial to tell which databases they come from. This poses a significant challenge for learning a unified HRTF representation across databases. In this work, we first identify the possible causes of these cross-database differences, attributing them to variations in the measurement setup. Then, we propose a \u2026",

On the basis of two hypotheses, we suggest an approach for perturbing phase information during the training of time-domain CM systems. Communication networks often employ lossy compression codec that encodes only magnitude information, therefore heavily altering phase information. Also, state-of-the-art CM systems rely on phase information to identify spoofed speech. Thus, we believe the information loss in the phase domain induced by lossy compression codec degrades the performance of the unseen channel. We first establish the dependence of time-domain CM systems on phase information by perturbing phase in evaluation, showing strong degradation. Then, we demonstrated that perturbing phase during training leads to a significant performance improvement, whereas perturbing magnitude leads to further degradation.",

However, voice can be easily forged with replay, text-to-speech (TTS), and voice conversion (VC) techniques, which may compromise ASV systems. Voice presentation attack detection (PAD) is developed to improve the reliability of speaker verification systems against such spoofing attacks. One main issue of voice PAD systems is its generalization ability to unseen synthetic attacks, i.e., synthesis methods that are not seen during training of the presentation attack detection models. We propose one-class learning, where the model compacts the distribution of learned representations of bona fide speech while pushing away spoofing attacks to improve the results. Another issue is the robustness to variations of acoustic and telecommunication channels. To alleviate this issue, we propose channel-robust training \u2026",

    "abstract": "Searching sounds by text labels is often difficult, as text descriptions cannot describe the audio content in detail. Query by vocal imitation bridges such gap and provides a novel way to sound search. Several algorithms for sound search by vocal imitation have been proposed and evaluated in a simulation environment, however, they have not been deployed into a real search engine nor evaluated by real users. This pilot work conducts a subjective study to compare these two approaches to sound search, and tries to answer the question of which approach works better for what kinds of sounds. To do so, we developed two web-based search engines for sound, one by vocal imitation (Vroom!) and the other by text description (TextSearch). We also developed an experimental framework to host these engines to collect statistics of user behaviors and ratings. Results showed that Vroom! received significantly higher search satisfaction ratings than TextSearch did for sound categories that were difficult for subjects to describe by text. Results also showed a better overall ease-of-use rating for Vroom! than TextSearch on the limited sound library in our experiments. These findings suggest advantages of vocal-imitation-based search for sound in practice.",

In practical use cases, new generation algorithms are continually emerging, and these algorithms are not encountered during the development of detection methods. This calls for the generalization ability of the method. Additionally, to ensure the credibility of detection methods, it is beneficial for the model to interpret which cues from the video indicate it is fake. Motivated by these considerations, we then propose a multi-stream fusion approach with one-class learning as a representation-level regularization technique. We study the generalization problem of audio-visual deepfake detection by creating a new benchmark by extending and re-splitting the existing FakeAVCeleb dataset. The benchmark contains four categories of fake video(Real Audio-Fake Visual, Fake Audio-Fake Visual, Fake Audio-Real Visual, and unsynchronized video). The experimental results show that our approach improves the model's detection of unseen attacks by an average of 7.31% across four test sets, compared to the baseline model.

    "abstract": "The neural semi-Markov Conditional Random Field (semi-CRF) framework has demonstrated promise for event-based piano transcription. In this framework, all events (notes or pedals) are represented as closed intervals tied to specific event types. The neural semi-CRF approach requires an interval scoring matrix that assigns a score for every candidate interval. However, designing an efficient and expressive architecture for scoring intervals is not trivial. In this paper, we introduce a simple method for scoring intervals using scaled inner product operations that resemble how attention scoring is done in transformers. We show theoretically that, due to the special structure from encoding the non-overlapping intervals, under a mild condition, the inner product operations are expressive enough to represent an ideal scoring matrix that can yield the correct transcription result. We then demonstrate that an encoder-only non-hierarchical transformer backbone, operating only on a low-time-resolution feature map, is capable of transcribing piano notes and pedals with high accuracy and time precision. The experiment shows that our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks in terms of the F1 measure on the Maestro dataset.",

    "title": "Harmonic Analysis With Neural Semi-CRF.",
    "abstract": "Automatic harmonic analysis of symbolic music is an important and useful task for both composers and listeners. The task consists of two components: recognizing harmony labels and finding their time boundaries. Most of the previous attempts focused on the first component, while time boundaries were rarely modeled explicitly. Lack of boundary modeling in the objective function could lead to segmentation errors. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach named Harana, to jointly detect the labels and boundaries of harmonic regions using neural semi-CRF (conditional random field). In contrast to rule-based scores used in traditional semi-CRF, a neural score function is proposed to incorporate features with more representational power. To improve the robustness of the model to imperfect harmony profiles, we design an additional score component to penalize the match between the candidate harmony label and the absent notes in the music. Quantitative results from our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach improves segmentation quality as well as frame-level accuracy compared to previous methods.

    "abstract": "Human voices can be used to authenticate the identity of the speaker, but the automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems are vulnerable to voice spoofing attacks, such as impersonation, replay, text-to-speech, and voice conversion. Recently, researchers developed anti-spoofing techniques to improve the reliability of ASV systems against spoofing attacks. However, most methods encounter difficulties in detecting unknown attacks in practical use, which often have different statistical distributions from known attacks. In this work, we propose an anti-spoofing system to detect unknown logical access attacks (ie, synthetic speech) using one-class learning. The key idea is to compact the genuine speech representation and inject an angular margin to separate the spoofing attacks in the embedding space. Our system achieves an equal error rate of 2.19% on the evaluation set of ASVspoof 2019 Challenge, outperforming all existing single systems.",

The current study explores the extent of relationship between lyrics and melodies quantitatively in a large dataset of pop songs written in Cantonese, a language with one of the richest tonal systems. To align the lyrics with corresponding melody, the singing voices are extracted from the polyphonic music tracks and automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are applied to the singing voices to detect the lyrics content as well as character-wise timestamps. The transcribed lyrics are matched with true lyrics using Levenshtein distance and then further corrected to ensure the lyrics are precisely sung in each melody segment.

Most existing transcription algorithms, especially those based on Non-negative matrix factorization and Probabilistic latent component analysis, operate on a spectrogram on a frame-by-frame basis, ie, they do not consider the temporal evolution of the notes of musical instruments, which in the case of percussive instruments is very characteristic. In our work, we propose a spectrogram factorization algorithm that uses the full spectrogram of sampled notes as template and a greedy algorithm to detect the templates to activate for a given chord. Combining this algorithm with a robust onset detection method will lead to a more accurate piano music transcription system. We also propose a new metric for spectrogram similarity.",

All submissions are built upon the frame-level Multi-pitch Estimation (MPE) results. Differently, the first submission \u201cDT1\u201d forms notes by just connecting pitch estimates that are close in both time and frequency, and then removes notes that are too short. Therefore, the formation of notes operates locally and does not consider interactions between different notes. The other two submissions \u201cDT2\u201d and \u201cDT3\u201d implement the idea presented in [6], which builds up a note sampling module based on results of \u201cDT1\u201d to sample subsets of notes as candidate transcriptions. It then builds a transcription evaluation module to select the best candidate as the final transcription. The evaluation module evaluates the likelihood of a transcription candidate in explaining the audio signal as a whole, considering the interactions between simultaneous notes. In \u201cDT2\u201d, notes are sampled based on their salience and length; while in \u201cDT3\u201d, the sampling also depends on the support of a note received from other notes in the transcription, which further considers interactions between notes.",

The mechanism is a new online graph restructuring algorithm we refer to as islandization. The proposed algorithm finds clusters of nodes with strong internal but weak external connections.

In this article we propose a framework, called FPDeep, which uses a hybrid of model and layer parallelism to configure distributed reconfigurable clusters to train CNNs. This approach has numerous benefits. First, the design does not suffer from performance loss due to batch size growth.

To address this emerging challenge, researchers have proposed approximate DNNs with reduced precision, e.g., Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs). While BNNs can be built to have little loss in accuracy, latency reduction still has much room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a single-FPGA-based BNN accelerator that achieves microsecond-level ultra-low-latency inference of ImageNet, LP-BNN.

Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is a well-known architecture for multi-scale feature learning, however, intrinsic weaknesses in feature extraction and fusion impede the production of informative features. This work addresses the weaknesses of FPN through a novel tripartite feature enhanced pyramid network (TFPN), with three distinct and effective designs. First, we develop a feature reference module with lateral connections to adaptively extract bottom-up features with richer details for feature pyramid construction. Second, we design a feature calibration module between adjacent layers that calibrates the upsampled features to be spatially aligned, allowing for feature fusion with accurate correspondences.

However, it can be notoriously challenging to inference GCNs over large graph datasets, limiting their application to large real-world graphs and hindering the exploration of deeper and more sophisticated GCN graphs. This is because real-world graphs can be extremely large and sparse. Furthermore, the node degree of GCNs tends to follow the power-law distribution and therefore have highly irregular adjacency matrices, resulting in prohibitive inefficiencies in both data processing and movement and thus substantially limiting the achievable GCN acceleration efficiency.

In particular, Ising-Traffic formulates traffic prediction under uncertainty into two Ising models: Reconstruct-Ising and Predict-Ising. Reconstruct-Ising is mapped onto modern Ising machines and handles uncertainty in traffic accurately with negligible latency and energy consumption, while Predict-Ising is mapped onto traditional processors and predicts future congestion precisely with only at most 1.8% computational demands of existing solutions.

    "abstract": "The growth of the Machine-Learning-As-A-Service (MLaaS) market has highlighted clients' data privacy and security issues. Private inference (PI) techniques using cryptographic primitives offer a solution but often have high computation and communication costs, particularly with non-linear operators like ReLU. Many attempts to reduce ReLU operations exist, but they may need heuristic threshold selection or cause substantial accuracy loss. This work introduces AutoReP, a gradient-based approach to lessen non-linear operators and alleviate these issues. It automates the selection of ReLU and polynomial functions to speed up PI applications and introduces distribution-aware polynomial approximation (DaPa) to maintain model expressivity while accurately approximating ReLUs. Our experimental results demonstrate significant accuracy improvements of 6.12%(94.31%, 12.9 K ReLU budget, CIFAR-10), 8.39%(74.92%, 12.9 K ReLU budget, CIFAR-100), and 9.45%(63.69%, 55K ReLU budget, Tiny-ImageNet) over current state-of-the-art methods, eg, SNL. Morever, AutoReP is applied to EfficientNet-B2 on ImageNet dataset, and achieved 75.55% accuracy with 176.1 xReLU budget reduction.",

The deployment of GCNs in the cloud raises privacy concerns due to potential adversarial attacks on client data. To address security concerns, Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) using Homomorphic Encryption (HE) secures sensitive client data. However, it introduces substantial computational overhead in practical applications. To tackle those challenges, we present LinGCN, a framework designed to reduce multiplication depth and optimize the performance of HE based GCN inference. LinGCN is structured around three key elements:(1) A differentiable structural linearization algorithm, complemented by a parameterized discrete indicator function, co-trained with model weights to meet the optimization goal. This strategy promotes fine-grained node-level non-linear location selection, resulting in a model with minimized multiplication depth.(2) A compact node-wise polynomial replacement policy with a second-order trainable activation function, steered towards superior convergence by a two-level distillation approach from an all-ReLU based teacher model.(3) an enhanced HE solution that enables finer-grained operator fusion for node-wise activation functions, further reducing multiplication level consumption in HE-based inference.

    "abstract": "Binary neural networks (BNNs) show promising utilization in cost and power-restricted domains such as edge devices and mobile systems. This is due to its significantly less computation and storage demand, but at the cost of degraded performance. To close the accuracy gap, in this paper we propose to add a complementary activation function (AF) ahead of the sign based binarization, and rely on the genetic algorithm (GA) to automatically search for the ideal AFs. These AFs can help extract extra information from the input data in the forward pass, while allowing improved gradient approximation in the backward pass. Fifteen novel AFs are identified through our GA-based search, while most of them show improved performance (up to 2.54% on ImageNet) when testing on different datasets and network models. Interestingly, periodic functions are identified as a key component for most of the discovered AFs, which \u2026",

As far as we are aware there has been no previous work published on accelerating AMR with FPGAs. In this paper, we introduce a reconfigurable fabric framework called FP-AMR. The work is in two parts.

To mitigate these issues, secure multi-party computation (MPC) has been discussed, to enable the privacy-preserving DL computation. In practice, they often come at very high computation and communication overhead, and potentially prohibit their popularity in large scale systems. Two orthogonal research trends have attracted enormous interests in addressing the energy efficiency in secure deep learning, i.e., overhead reduction of MPC comparison protocol, and hardware acceleration. However, they either achieve a low reduction ratio and suffer from high latency due to limited computation and communication saving, or are power-hungry as existing works mainly focus on general computing platforms such as CPUs and GPUs. In this work, as the first attempt, we develop a systematic framework, PolyMPCNet, of joint overhead reduction of MPC comparison protocol and hardware acceleration, by integrating hardware latency of the cryptographic building block into the DNN loss function to achieve high energy efficiency, accuracy, and security guarantee. Instead of heuristically checking the model sensitivity after a DNN is well-trained (through deleting or dropping some non-polynomial operators), our key design principle is to em enforce exactly what is assumed in the DNN design -- training a DNN that is both hardware efficient and secure, while escaping the local minima and saddle points and maintaining high accuracy.

    "title": "Towards Real-Time Temporal Graph Learning",
    "abstract": "In recent years, graph representation learning has gained significant popularity, which aims to generate node embeddings that capture features of graphs. One of the methods to achieve this is employing a technique called random walks that captures node sequences in a graph and then learns embeddings for each node using a natural language processing technique called Word2Vec. These embeddings are then used for deep learning on graph data for classification tasks, such as link prediction or node classification. Prior work operates on pre-collected temporal graph data and is not designed to handle updates on a graph in real-time. Real world graphs change dynamically and their entire temporal updates are not available upfront. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end graph learning pipeline that performs temporal graph construction, creates low-dimensional node embeddings, and trains multi-layer \u2026",

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in parallel processing is the difficulty in efficiently partitioning work: the result is that much of a parallel program's execution time is often spent idle or performing overhead operations. We propose to improve the efficiency of system resource utilization by having idle processes execute extra work. We develop a method whereby the execution of extra work is optimized through performance prediction and the setting of limits (a deadline) on the duration of the extra work execution. In our preliminary experiments of proxy BSP applications on a production supercomputer we find that this approach is promising with all five applications benefiting from this approach, with an average of 12 % improvement.",

To accelerate a small data set that is executed for a large number of iterations, high-efficiency is required.

The problem addressed here is that, as the number of on-chip processors has increased from fewer than 10 into the hundreds, previous intra-chip routing solutions are no longer viable. We find, however, that through various design innovations, high efficiency can be maintained.

If we can harness some of that computation at an appropriate level, we can potentially perform certain type of computation (much) faster and more efficiently than we can do with a von Neumann computer. Indeed, many powerful algorithms are inspired by nature and are thus prime candidates for nature-based computation. One particular branch of this effort that has seen some recent rapid advances is Ising machines. Some Ising machines are already showing better performance and energy efficiency for optimization problems. Through design iterations and co-evolution between hardware and algorithm, we expect more benefits from nature-based computing systems in the future.

    "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed the emergence of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and their widespread adoption in, not only image processing and speech recognition, but also supercomputing scenarios such as extreme big-data processing for in-situ analysis. To obtain improved prediction accuracy, DNNs are becoming deeper and more complex, leading to increasingly long processing latency and high resource demand. So far, the use of accelerators has achieved only limited benefit in real-time domains with strict latency constraints [2], such as autonomous driving and robotic control. Since DNNs can often tolerate some inaccuracy, researchers have begun exploring reduced bit-width for DNN training and inference. Many new designs have been proposed; the Binarized-Neural-Network (BNN)[7] is particularly attractive. BNNs use a single bit to encode each neuron, significantly reducing compute complexity and memory demand, giving the potential to reduce inference delay by orders-of-magnitude. BNNs map particularly well to FPGAs: their configurability enables millions of one-bit ALUs to be implemented on a single device. In contrast, a report from Intel reports only 10% peak performance when running a BNN on a Xeon CPU and 7% for a Titan X GPU (with batch size of 10; a smaller batch size of about four is generally expected [6]). Despite the attractiveness of FPGAs for BNNs, creating a good design is still a major challenge, especially for a large network with big data (eg, AlexNet on ImageNet). To the best of our knowledge, the shortest reported latency of AlexNet inference is 1.16 ms [5], which is still far from real-time. The delay is \u2026",

In this study, we introduce $\\textbf{Fusion-LLM}$, a novel integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with classical reservoir computing paradigms tailored to address challenges in Inertial Confinement Fusion ($\\texttt{ICF}$). Our approach offers several key contributions: Firstly, we propose the $\\textit{LLM-anchored Reservoir}$, augmented with a fusion-specific prompt, enabling accurate forecasting of hot electron dynamics during implosion. Secondly, we develop $\\textit{Signal-Digesting Channels}$ to temporally and spatially describe the laser intensity across time, capturing the unique characteristics of $\\texttt{ICF}$ inputs. Lastly, we design the $\\textit{Confidence Scanner}$ to quantify the confidence level in forecasting, providing valuable insights for domain experts to design the $\\texttt{ICF}$ process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method, achieving 1.90 CAE, 0.14 $\\texttt{top-1}$ MAE, and 0.11 $\\texttt{top-5}$ MAE in predicting Hard X-ray ($\\texttt{HXR}$) energies of $\\texttt{ICF}$ tasks, which presents state-of-the-art comparisons against concurrent best systems. Additionally, we present $\\textbf{Fusion4AI}$, the first $\\texttt{ICF}$ benchmark based on physical experiments, aimed at fostering novel ideas in plasma physics research and enhancing the utility of LLMs in scientific exploration.

To mitigate this, we introduce a method that employs error-bounded lossy compression to reduce the communication data size and accelerate DLRM training. We develop a novel error-bounded lossy compression algorithm, informed by an in-depth analysis of embedding data features, to achieve high compression ratios. Moreover, we introduce a dual-level adaptive strategy for error-bound adjustment, spanning both table-wise and iteration-wise aspects, to balance the compression benefits with the potential impacts on accuracy. We further optimize our compressor for PyTorch tensors on GPUs, minimizing compression overhead. Evaluation shows that our method achieves a 1.38 training speedup with a minimal accuracy impact.",

Most significantly, MTL models tuned to analyze raw and unmasked XRD patterns achieved close performance to models analyzing preprocessed data, with minimal accuracy differences. This work indicates that advanced deep learning architectures like MTL can automate arduous data handling tasks, streamline the analysis of distorted XRD patterns, and reduce the reliance on labor-intensive experimental datasets.",

AMR operates by dynamically and adaptively applying computational resources non-uniformly to emphasize regions of the model as a function of their complexity. Because AMR generally uses dynamic and pointer-based data structures, acceleration is challenging, especially in hardware. As far as we are aware there has been no previous work published on accelerating AMR with FPGAs. In this paper, we introduce a reconfigurable fabric framework called FP-AMR. The work is in two parts. In the first FPAMR offloads the bulk per-timestep computations to the FPGA; analogous systems have previously done this with GPUs. In the second part we show that the rest of the CPU-based tasks\u2013including particle mesh mapping, mesh refinement, and coarsening\u2013can also be mapped efficiently to the FPGA. We have evaluated FP-AMR using the widely used program AMReX and found that a single FPGA outperforms a Xeon E5-2660 CPU server (8 cores) by from 21\u00d7-23\u00d7 depending on problem size and data distribution.",

We describe a proteome-wide binary protein-protein interaction map for the interactome network of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana containing~ 6,200 highly reliable interactions between~ 2,700 proteins. A global organization of plant biological processes emerges from community analyses of the resulting network, together with large numbers of novel hypothetical functional links between proteins and pathways. We observe a dynamic rewiring of interactions following gene duplication events, providing evidence for a model of evolution acting upon interactome networks. This and future plant interactome maps should facilitate systems approaches to better understand plant biology and improve crops.",

Furthermore, the high betweenness nodes display a non-trivial spatial clustering with increasing spatial correlation as a function of the edge-density. Our results suggest that the spatial distribution of betweenness is a more accurate discriminator than its statistics for comparing  static congestion \u2026",

The agents use strategies based on local information to improve their chance of success. Both the evolution of strategies and network structure are investigated. We find a dramatic time evolution with cascades of strategy change accompanied by a change in network structure. On average the network self-organizes to a state close to the transition between a fragmented state and a state with a giant component. Furthermore, with increasing system size both the average degree and the level of fragmentation decreases.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been holding the world hostage for several years now. Mobility is key to viral spreading and its restriction is the main non-pharmaceutical interventions to fight the virus expansion. Previous works have shown a connection between the structural organization of cities and the movement patterns of their residents. This puts urban centers in the focus of epidemic surveillance and interventions. Here we show that the organization of urban flows has a tremendous impact on disease spreading and on the amenability of different mitigation strategies. By studying anonymous and aggregated intra-urban flows in a variety of cities in the United States and other countries, and a combination of empirical analysis and analytical methods, we demonstrate that the response of cities to epidemic spreading can be roughly classified in two major types according to the overall organization of \u2026",

The fair agreement between theory and numerical simulations, enables us to derive an analytical expression for the epidemic threshold, capturing the critical conditions triggering epidemic outbreaks.

In most network models, and many empirical networks, closeness is strongly correlated with degree. However, in social networks there is a cost of maintaining social ties. This leads to a situation (that can occur in the professional social networks of executives, lobbyists, diplomats and so on) where agents have the conflicting objectives of aiming for centrality while simultaneously keeping the degree low. We investigate this situation in an adaptive network-evolution model where agents optimize their positions in the network following individual strategies, and using only local information. The strategies are also optimized, based on the success of the agent and its neighbors. We measure and describe the time evolution of the network and the agents\u2019 strategies.",

A variety of rich dynamical behavior has been uncovered, although usually in the context of a single state of synchronization or lack thereof. Through the experimental and numerical study of a large population of discrete chemical oscillators, here we report on the unexpected discovery of a new phenomenon revealing the existence of dynamically distinct synchronized states reflecting different degrees of communication.

Most healthcare service network models have been constructed from patient claims data, using billing claims to link a patient with a specific provider in time. The data sets can be quite large (106\u2013108 individual claims per year), making standard methods for network construction computationally challenging and thus requiring the use of alternate construction algorithms. While these alternate methods have seen increasing use in generating healthcare networks, there is little to no literature comparing the differences in the structural properties of the generated networks, which as we demonstrate, can be dramatically different. To address this issue, we compared the properties of healthcare networks constructed using different algorithms from 2013 Medicare Part B outpatient claims data. Three different algorithms were compared: binning, sliding frame, and trace-route. Unipartite networks linking either providers or healthcare organizations by shared patients were built using each method. We find that each algorithm produced networks with substantially different topological properties, as reflected by numbers of edges, network density, assortativity, clustering coefficients and other structural measures. Provider networks adhered to a power law, while organization networks were best fit by a power law with exponential cutoff.

Real world networks such as the world wide web, however, are not static and experience a considerable amount of turnover, where nodes and edges are both added and deleted. Considering degree-based node removals, we examine the possibility of preserving networks from these types of disruptions. We recover the original degree distribution by allowing the network to react to the attack by introducing new nodes and attaching their edges via specially tailored schemes. We focus particularly on the case of non-uniform failures, a \u2026",

Our analysis reveals that the characterization of the welfare of cities based on mobility information hinges on their corresponding development stage.

Another task is inferring the origin of a disease, which is relatively difficult with current mathematical models. Such frameworks, across varying levels of complexity, are typically sensitive to input data on epidemic parameters, case counts, and mortality rates, which are generally noisy and incomplete. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a maximum entropy framework that fits epidemiological models, provides calibrated infection origin probabilities, and is robust to noise due to a prior belief model. Maximum entropy is agnostic to the parameters or model structure used and allows for flexible use when faced with sparse data conditions and incomplete knowledge in the dynamical phase of disease-spread, providing for more reliable modeling at early stages of outbreaks \u2026",

    "abstract": "Nighttime lights satellite imagery has been used for decades as a uniform, global source of data for studying a wide range of socioeconomic factors. Recently, another more terrestrial source is producing data with similarly uniform global coverage: anonymous and aggregated smart phone location. This data, which measures the movement patterns of people and populations rather than the light they produce, could prove just as valuable in decades to come. In fact, since human mobility is far more directly related to the socioeconomic variables being predicted, it has an even greater potential. Additionally, since cell phone locations can be aggregated in real time while preserving individual user privacy, it will be possible to conduct studies that would previously have been impossible because they require data from the present. Of course, it will take quite some time to establish the new techniques necessary to apply human mobility data to problems traditionally studied with satellite imagery and to conceptualize and develop new real time applications. In this study we demonstrate that it is possible to accelerate this process by inferring artificial nighttime satellite imagery from human mobility data, while maintaining a strong differential privacy guarantee. We also show that these artificial maps can be used to infer socioeconomic variables, often with greater accuracy than using actual satellite imagery. Along the way, we find that the relationship between mobility and light emissions is both nonlinear and varies considerably around the globe. Finally, we show that models based on human mobility can significantly improve our understanding of society \u2026",

This approach is based on the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and provably makes the smallest change in the latent joint distribution to fit new data. This method requires no likelihood or model derivatives and its fit is insensitive to prior strength, removing the need to balance observed data fit with prior belief. The method requires the ansatz that data is fit in expectation, which is true in some settings and may be reasonable in all settings with few data points. The method is based on sample reweighting, so its asymptotic run time is independent of prior distribution \u2026",

We introduce three information-theoretic measures that quantify novelty, innovation, and impact from scholarly citation networks, and compare the scholarly output of scientists who are either not connected or strongly connected to superstar scientists. We find that while connected scientists do indeed publish more, garner more citations, and produce more diverse content, this comes at a cost of lower innovation and higher redundancy of ideas. Further, once one removes papers co-authored with superstars, the academic output of these connected scientists diminishes. In contrast, authors that produce innovative content without the benefit of collaborations with scientific superstars produce papers that connect a greater diversity of concepts, publish more, and have comparable citation rates, once one controls for transferred prestige of superstars.

Social media platforms often facilitate such tendencies of homophily and echo-chambers as they promote highly personalized content to maximize user engagement. However, increased belief rigidity can negatively affect real-world policy decisions such as leading to climate change inaction and increased vaccine hesitancy. To understand and effectively tackle belief rigidity on online social networks, designing and evaluating various intervention strategies is crucial, and increasing randomization in the network can be considered one such intervention. In this paper, we empirically quantify the effects of a randomized social network structure on belief rigidity, specifically examining the potential benefits of introducing randomness into the network. We show that individuals' beliefs are positively influenced by peer opinions, regardless of whether those opinions are similar to or differ from their own by passively sensing belief rigidity through our experimental framework. Moreover, people incorporate a slightly higher variety of different peers (based on their opinions) into their networks when the recommendation algorithm provides them with diverse content, compared to when it provides them with similar content. Our results indicate that in some cases, there might be benefits to randomization, providing empirical evidence that a more randomized network could be a feasible way of helping people get out of their echo-chambers.

In this study we describe the steps required to {\\it operationalize} SIT via its application to dynamical problems. Our road map has four steps: (1) separating the dynamical system into agent-environment sub-systems; (2) choosing an appropriate coarse graining and quantifying correlations; (3) identifying a measure of viability; (4) implementing a scrambling protocol and measuring the semantic content. We apply the road map to a model inspired by the neural dynamics of epileptic seizures whereby an agent (a control process) attempts to maintain an environment (a base process) in a desynchronized state. The synchronization dynamics is studied through the well-known Kuramoto model of phase synchronization. Our application of SIT to this problem reveals new features of both semantic information and the Kuramoto model. For the latter we find articulating the correlational structure for agent and environment(the oscillators), allows us to cast the model in in a novel computational (information theoretic) perspective, where the agent-environment dynamics can be thought of as analyzing a communication channel. For the former we find that all the information in our system is semantic. This is in contrast to previous SIT studies of foragers in which semantic thresholds where seen above which no further semantic content was obtained.",

    "abstract": "The spatial configuration of urban amenities and the streets connecting them collectively provide the structural backbone of a city, influencing its accessibility, vitality and ultimately the well-being of its residents. Most accessibility measures focus on the proximity of amenities in space or along transportation networks, resulting in metrics largely determined by urban density alone. These measures are unable to gauge how efficiently street networks can navigate between amenities, since they neglect the circuity component of accessibility. Existing measures also often require ad hoc modelling choices, making them less flexible for different applications and difficult to apply in cross-sectional analyses. Here, we develop a simple, principled and flexible measure to characterize the circuity of accessibility among heterogeneous amenities in a city, which we call the pairwise circuity (PC). The PC quantifies the excess travel \u2026",

    "abstract": "In the absence of vaccines, the most widespread reaction to curb the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide was the implementation of lockdowns or stay-at-home policies. Despite the reported usefulness of such policies, their efficiency was highly constrained by socioeconomic factors determining their feasibility and their associated outcome in terms of mobility reduction and the subsequent limitation of social activity. Here we investigate the impact of lockdown policies on the mobility patterns of different socioeconomic classes in the three major cities of Colombia during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. In global terms, we find a consistent positive correlation between the reduction in mobility levels and the socioeconomic stratum of the population in the three cities, implying that those with lower incomes were less capable of adopting the aforementioned policies. Our analysis also suggests a strong restructuring \u2026",

    "abstract": "Human travelling behaviours are markedly regular, to a large extent, predictable, and mostly driven by biological necessities (\\eg sleeping, eating) and social constructs (\\eg school schedules, synchronisation of labour). Not surprisingly, such predictability is influenced by an array of factors ranging in scale from individual (\\eg preference, choices) and social (\\eg household, groups) all the way to global scale (\\eg mobility restrictions in a pandemic). In this work, we explore how spatio-temporal patterns in individual-level mobility, which we refer to as \\emph{predictability states}, carry a large degree of information regarding the nature of the regularities in mobility. Our findings indicate the existence of contextual and activity signatures in predictability states, pointing towards the potential for more sophisticated, data-driven approaches to short-term, higher-order mobility predictions beyond frequentist/probabilistic methods.",

    "abstract": "To mitigate the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, officials have employed social distancing and stay-at-home measures, with increased attention to room ventilation emerging only more recently. Effective distancing practices for open spaces can be ineffective for poorly ventilated spaces, both of which are commonly filled with turbulent air. This is typical for indoor spaces that use mixing ventilation. While turbulence initially reduces the risk of infection near a virion-source, it eventually increases the exposure risk for all occupants in a space without ventilation. To complement detailed models aimed at precision, minimalist frameworks are useful to facilitate order of magnitude estimates for how much ventilation provides safety, particularly when circumstances require practical decisions with limited options. Applying basic principles of transport and diffusion, we estimate the time-scale for virions injected into a room of turbulent air to infect an occupant, distinguishing cases of low vs. high initial virion mass loads and virion-destroying vs. virion-reflecting walls. We consider the effect of an open window as a proxy for ventilation. When the airflow is dominated by isotropic turbulence, the minimum area needed to ensure safety depends only on the ratio of total viral load to threshold load for infection. The minimalist estimates here convey simply that the equivalent of ventilation by modest sized open window in classrooms and workplaces significantly improves safety.",

Chapter 1 begins with linguistic background on the definition of semantic roles and the controversies surrounding them. Chapter 2 describes how the theories have led to structured lexicons such as FrameNet, VerbNet and the PropBank Frame Files that in turn provide the basis for large scale semantic annotation of corpora. This data has facilitated the development of automatic semantic role labeling systems based on supervised machine learning techniques. Chapter 3 presents the general principles of applying both supervised and unsupervised machine learning to this task, with a description of the standard stages and feature choices, as well as giving details of several specific systems. Recent advances include the use of joint inference to take advantage of context sensitivities, and attempts to improve performance by closer integration of the syntactic parsing task with semantic role labeling. Chapter 3 also discusses the impact the granularity of the semantic roles has on system performance. Having outlined the basic approach with respect to English, Chapter 4 goes on to discuss applying the same techniques to other languages, using Chinese as the primary example. Although substantial training data is available for Chinese, this is not the case for many other languages, and techniques for projecting English role labels onto parallel corpora are also presented.

We examine these questions by comparing results for the Brown and WSJ corpora, and also consider which parts of the parser's probability model are particularly tuned to the corpus on which it was trained.

Tests on English data show that English shows a strong effect of DLM, with dependency length much closer to optimal than to random; the optimal English grammar also has many specific features in common with English.

We build a model by analyzing 138 recorded interview videos (total duration of 10.5 hours) of 69 internship-seeking students from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as they spoke with professional career counselors. Our automated analysis includes facial expressions (e.g., smiles, head gestures), language (e.g., word counts, topic modeling), and prosodic information (e.g., pitch, intonation, pauses) of the interviewees. We derive the ground truth labels by averaging over the ratings of 9 independent judges.

However, coreference is limited in providing information for rich inference. We introduce a new method for better connecting global evidence, which forms more complex graphs compared to DAGs. To perform evidence integration on our graphs, we investigate two recent graph neural networks, namely graph convolutional network (GCN) and graph recurrent network (GRN). Experiments on two standard datasets show that richer global information leads to better answers. Our method performs better than all published results on these datasets.",

    "title": "Learning bias and phonological-rule induction",
    "abstract": "A fundamental debate in the machine learning of language has been the role of prior knowledge in the learning process. Nativist models suggest that learning in a complex domain like natural language requires that the learning mechanism either have some previous knowledge about language, or some learning bias that helps direct the formation of correct generalizations. In linguistics, theories of such prior knowledge are referred to as Universal Grammar (UG); nativist linguistic models of learning assume, implicitly or explicitly, that some kind of prior knowledge that contributes to language learning is innate, a product of evolution. Despite sharing this assumption, nativist researchers disagree strongly about the exact constitution of this Universal Grammar. Many models, for example, assume that much of the prior knowledge that children bring to bear in learning language is not linguistic at all, but derives from constraints imposed by our general cognitive architecture. Others, such the influential Principles and Parameters model (Chomsky 1981), assert that what is innate is linguistic knowledge itself, and that the learning process consists mainly of searching for the values of a relatively small number of parameters. Such nativist models of phonological learning include, for example, Dresher and Kaye's (1990) model of the acquisition of stress-assignment rules, and Tesar and Smolensky's (1993) model of learning in Optimality Theory.Other scholars have argued that a purely nativist, parameterized learning algorithm is incapable of dealing with the noise, irregularity, and great variation of human language data, and that a more empiricist learning \u2026",

The structured space of a synchronous grammar is a natural fit for phrase pair probability estimation, though the search space can be prohibitively large. Therefore we explore efficient algorithms for pruning this space that lead to empirically effective results. Incorporating a sparse prior using Variational Bayes, biases the models toward generalizable, parsimonious parameter sets, leading to significant improvements in word alignment. This preference for sparse solutions together with effective pruning methods forms a phrase alignment regimen that produces better end-to-end translations than standard word alignment approaches.",

We propose a deterministic anti-annealing algorithm, that significantly improves the speed of convergence of EM for such mixtures with unbalanced mixing coefficients. The proposed algorithm is compared against other standard optimization techniques like BFGS, Conjugate Gradient, and the traditional EM algorithm.

    "title": "Syntax for statistical machine translation",
    "abstract": "In recent evaluations of machine translation systems, statistical systems have outperformed classical approaches based on interpretation, transfer, and generation. Nonetheless, the output of statistical systems often contains obvious grammatical errors. This can be attributed to the fact that the syntactic well-formedness is only influenced by local n-gram language models and simple alignment models. We aim to integrate syntactic structure into statistical models to address this problem. In the workshop we start with a very strong baseline\u2013the alignment template statistical machine translation system that obtained the best results in the 2002 and 2003 DARPA MT evaluations. This model is based on a log-linear modeling framework, which allows for the easy integration of many different knowledge sources (ie feature functions) into an overall model and to train the feature function combination weights discriminatively. During the workshop, we incrementally add new features representing syntactic knowledge that deal with specific problems of the underlying baseline. We want to investigate a broad range of possible feature functions, from very simple binary features to sophisticated treeto-tree translation models. Simple feature functions test if a certain constituent occurs in the source and the target language parse tree. More sophisticated features are derived from an alignment model where whole sub-trees in source and target can be aligned node by node. We also plan to investigate features based on projection of parse trees from one language onto strings of another, a useful technique when parses are available for only one of the two languages \u2026",

    "title": "Unsupervised Alignment of Actions in Video with Text Descriptions.",
    "abstract": "Advances in video technology and data storage have made large scale video data collections of complex activities readily accessible. An increasingly popular approach for automatically inferring the details of a video is to associate the spatiotemporal segments in a video with its natural language descriptions. Most algorithms for connecting natural language with video rely on pre-aligned supervised training data. Recently, several models have been shown to be effective for unsupervised alignment of objects in video with language. However, it remains difficult to generate good spatiotemporal video segments for actions that align well with language. This paper presents a framework that extracts higher level representations of lowlevel action features through hyperfeature coding from video and aligns them with language. We propose a two-step process that creates a highlevel action feature codebook with temporally consistent motions, and then applies an unsupervised alignment algorithm over the action codewords and verbs in the language to identify individual activities. We show an improvement over previous alignment models of objects and nouns on videos of biological experiments, and also evaluate our system on a larger scale collection of videos involving kitchen activities.",

    "title": "Natural language generation in the context of machine translation",
    "abstract": "Let\u2019s imagine a system for translating a sentence from a foreign language (say Czech, but substitute any of your favorite languages here) into your native language (say English). Such a system works as follows. It analyzes the foreign-language sentence to obtain a structural representation that captures its essence, ie\u201d who did what to whom where.\u201d It then translates (or \u201ctransfers\u201d) the actors, actions, etc. into words in your language while\u201d copying over\u201d the deeper relationships between them. Finally it synthesizes a syntactically well-formed sentence that conveys the essential meaning of the original sentence. Each step in this process is a hard technical problem, to which the best known solutions are either not adequate, or good enough only in narrow application domains, failing when applied to other domains. This summer, we have concentrated on improving one of these three steps, namely the synthesis (or generation), while having in mind that some of the core technologies can be applied to other parts of an MT system if the basic principle (ie, using graph tree representations with only local transformations) is kept.The target language for generation has been English, and the source language to the MT system has been a language of a different type (Czech). We have been able to produce automatically a fairly deeply analyzed sentence structure of the source language (albeit imperfect, of course). The incorporation of the deep analysis makes the whole approach very novel-so far no large-coverage translation system has tried to operate with such a structure, and the application to more diverse languages than, say, English and French, has \u2026",

For this task, dependency syntax has been recognized as a crucial source of features. Yet in the medical domain, 1-best parse trees suffer from relatively low accuracies, diminishing their usefulness. We investigate a method to alleviate this problem by utilizing dependency forests. Forests contain many possible decisions and therefore have higher recall but more noise compared with 1-best outputs. A graph neural network is used to represent the forests, automatically distinguishing the useful syntactic information from parsing noise. Results on two biomedical benchmarks show that our method outperforms the standard tree-based methods, giving the state-of-the-art results in the literature.",

The trigram pass closes most of the performance gap between a bigram decoder and a much slower trigram decoder, but takes time that is insignificant in comparison to the bigram pass. An additional fast decoding pass maximizing the expected count of correct translation hypotheses increases the BLEU score significantly.",

The learned rules are represented as finite state transducers that accept underlying forms as input and generate surface forms as output. The algorithm for learning them is an extension of the OSTIA algorithm for learning general subsequential finite state transducers. Although OSTIA is capable of learning arbitrary s.-fst's in the limit, large dictionaries of actual English pronunciations did not give enough samples to correctly induce phonological rules. We then augmented OSTIA with two kinds of knowledge specific to natural language phonology, biases from\" universal grammar\". One bias is that underlying phones are often realized as phonetically similar or identical surface phones. The other biases phonological rules to apply across natural phonological classes. The additions helped in learning more compact, accurate, and general transducers than the unmodified OSTIA algorithm. An implementation of the algorithm successfully learns a number of English postlexical rules.",

We propose SEMBLEU, a robust metric that extends BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) to AMRs. It does not suffer from search errors and considers non-local correspondences in addition to local ones. SEMBLEU is fully content-driven and punishes situations where a system's output does not preserve most information from the input. Preliminary experiments on both sentence and corpus levels show that SEMBLEU has slightly higher consistency with human judgments than SMATCH.

Vexing problems of aspectual composition lend themselves to simple analyses in terms of the context-sensitive interaction between verb-specific x-schemas and a controller x-schema that captures important regularities in the evolution of events. The resulting x-schemas can be elaborated and constrained by such factors as tense, temporal modifiers, nominals and pragmatic context, providing a rich representation that supports simulative inference in language \u2026",

In this article, we study the latter in depth, demonstrating several new results, including a practical recognition algorithm that can be used for inference and learning with models defined on DAG automata. We also propose an extension to graphs with unbounded node degree and show that our results carry over to the extended formalism.",

We built a fertility hidden Markov model by adding fertility to the hidden Markov model. This model not only achieves lower alignment error rate than the hidden Markov model, but also runs faster.

We use Gibbs sampling for parameter estimation, which is more principled than the neighborhood method used in IBM Model 4.",

We transform the sequence to graph mapping problem to a word sequence to transition action sequence problem using a special transition system called a cache transition system. To address the sparsity issue of neural AMR parsing, we feed feature embeddings from the transition state to provide relevant local information for each decoder state. We present a monotonic hard attention model for the transition framework to handle the strictly left-to-right alignment between each transition state and the current buffer input focus. We evaluate our neural transition model on the AMR parsing task, and our parser outperforms other sequence-to-sequence approaches and achieves competitive results in comparison with the best-performing models.",

The size of the cache provides a parameter that can trade off between the complexity of the graphs that can be built and the ease of predicting actions during parsing. Our results show that a cache transition system can cover almost all AMR graphs with a small cache size, and our end-to-end system achieves competitive results in comparison with other transition-based approaches for AMR parsing.",

Using Monte Carlo simulations over data from five languages, we find that their word orders are efficient for processing in terms of both dependency length and local lexical probability.

In the testing stage, our method represents each instance as a contextual vector, and induces its sense by finding the nearest sense centroid in the embedding space. The advantages of our method are (1) distributed sense vectors are taken as the knowledge representations which are trained discriminatively, and usually have better performance than traditional count-based distributional models, and (2) a general model for the whole vocabulary is jointly trained to induce sense centroids under the mutlitask learning framework. Evaluated on SemEval-2010 WSI dataset, our method outperforms all participants and most of the recent state-of-the-art methods. We further verify the two advantages by comparing with carefully designed baselines.",

We describe a model-based approach that learns a TSG using Gibbs sampling with a non-parametric prior to control fragment size, yielding grammars that contain mostly small fragments but that include larger ones as the data permits.

To perform evidence integration on our graphs, we investigate two recent graph neural networks, namely graph convolutional network (GCN) and graph recurrent network (GRN).

Understanding this variation is essential both for cognitive modeling of lexical production and for computer speech recognition and synthesis. This study investigates which factors affect the forms of function words, especially whether they have a fuller pronunciation (eg,, \u0438, \u0432, \u041e\u043a) or a more reduced or lenited pronunciation (eg,, \u041d\u0438, \u0432,). It is based on over 8000 occurrences of ten frequent English function words in a four-hour sample from conversations from the Switchboard corpus. Ordinary linear and logistic regression models were used to examine variation in the length of the words, in the form of their vowel (basic, full, or reduced), and whether final obstruents were present or not. For all these measures, after controlling for segmental context, rate of speech, and other important factors, there are strong independent effects that made function words more likely to be longer or have a fuller form (1) when neighboring disfluencies (such as filled pauses uh and um) indicate that the speaker was encountering problems in planning the utterance;(2) when the word is unexpected, ie less predictable in context;(3) when the word is either utterance-initial or utterance-final. Looking at the phenomenon in a different way, function words are more likely to be shorter and to have less full forms in fluent speech, in predictable positions or multi-word collocations, and utterance-internally. Also considered are other factors such as sex (women are more likely to use fuller forms, even after controlling for rate of speech, for example), and some of the differences among the ten function words in their \u2026",

    "abstract": "Utterance rewriting aims to recover coreferences and omitted information from the latest turn of a multi-turn dialogue. Recently, methods that tag rather than linearly generate sequences have proven stronger in both in-and out-of-domain rewriting settings. This is due to a tagger's smaller search space as it can only copy tokens from the dialogue context. However, these methods may suffer from low coverage when phrases that must be added to a source utterance cannot be covered by a single context span. This can occur in languages like English that introduce tokens such as prepositions into the rewrite for grammaticality. We propose a hierarchical context tagger (HCT) that mitigates this issue by predicting slotted rules (eg,\" besides _\") whose slots are later filled with context spans. HCT (i) tags the source string with token-level edit actions and slotted rules and (ii) fills in the resulting rule slots with spans from the dialogue context. This rule tagging allows HCT to add out-of-context tokens and multiple spans at once; we further cluster the rules to truncate the long tail of the rule distribution. Experiments on several benchmarks show that HCT can outperform state-of-the-art rewriting systems by~ 2 BLEU points.",

    "title": "Plurality, negation, and quantification: Towards comprehensive quantifier scope disambiguation",
    "abstract": "Recent work on statistical quantifier scope disambiguation (QSD) has improved upon earlier work by scoping an arbitrary number and type of noun phrases. No corpusbased method, however, has yet addressed QSD when incorporating the implicit universal of plurals and/or operators such as negation. In this paper we report early, though promising, results for automatic QSD when handling both phenomena. We also present a general model for learning to build partial orders from a set of pairwise preferences. We give an nlog n algorithm for finding a guaranteed approximation of the optimal solution, which works very well in practice. Finally, we significantly improve the performance of the previous model using a rich set of automatically generated features. 1 IntroductionThe sentence there is one faculty member in every graduate committee is ambiguous with respect to quantifier scoping, since there are at least two possible readings: If one has wide scope, there is a unique faculty member on every committee. If every has wide scope, there can be different faculty members on each committee. Over the past decade there has been some work on statistical quantifier scope disambiguation (QSD)(Higgins and Sadock, 2003; Galen and MacCartney, 2004; Manshadi and Allen, 2011a). However, the extent of the work has been quite limited for several reasons. First, in the past two decades, the main focus of the NLP community has been on shallow text processing. As a deep processing task, QSD is not essential for many NLP applications that do not require deep understanding. Second, there has been a lack of comprehensive scope-disambiguated \u2026",

Many are browsing instead of searching for specific information, and a smaller number use the system to check schedules for transit routes they use every day.

Although these operations provide local context, the distance messages can travel is bounded by the number of encoder propagation steps. We adopt recent efforts of applying Transformer self-attention to graphs to allow global feature propagation. Instead of feeding shortest paths to the vertex self-attention module, we train a model to learn them using generalized shortest-paths algorithms. This approach widens the receptive field of a graph encoder by exposing it to all possible graph paths. We explore how this path diversity affects performance across levels of AMR connectivity, demonstrating gains on AMRs of higher reentrancy counts and diameters. Analysis of generated sentences also supports high semantic coherence of our models for reentrant AMRs. Our best model achieves a 1.4 BLEU and 1.8 chrF++ margin over a baseline that encodes only pairwise-unique shortest paths.",

Applied after rule binarization, weight pushing takes the weight from the original grammar rule and pushes it down across its binarized pieces, allowing the parser to make better pruning decisions earlier in the parsing process. This process can be viewed as generalizing weight pushing from transducers to hypergraphs. We examine its effect on parsing efficiency with various binarization schemes applied to tree substitution grammars from previous work. We find that weight pushing produces dramatic improvements in efficiency, especially with small amounts of time and with large grammars.",

Metrics leveraging contextualized embeddings appear more flexible than their n-gram matching counterparts and thus ideal as training rewards. However, metrics such as BERTScore greedily align candidate and reference tokens, which can allow system outputs to receive excess credit relative to a reference. Furthermore, past approaches featuring semantic similarity rewards suffer from repetitive outputs and overfitting. We address these issues by proposing metrics that replace the greedy alignments in BERTScore with optimized ones. We compute them on a model\u2019s trained token embeddings to prevent domain mismatch. Our model optimizing discrete alignment metrics consistently outperforms cross-entropy and BLEU reward baselines on AMR-to-text generation. In addition, we find that this approach enjoys stable training compared to a non-RL setting.",

Although frequency-based approaches\u2014for example, distributional semantics\u2014provide effective and concrete solutions for natural language applications, they still fail to fully reconcile the field with the theoreticallinguistic soul. In contrast, semantic role labeling (SRL), a recent new area of CL, aims to automatically provide (shallow) semantic layers using modern linguistic theories of semantic roles, also exploitable by language applications. The centrality and importance of such theories in CL has promoted the development of a rather large body of work on SRL; its many aspects and research directions make it difficult to survey the field. Palmer, Gildea, and Xue\u2019s book provides an excellent description of such work, detailing all its main concepts and practical aspects. The authors accurately illustrate all important ingredients to acquire a global and precise view of the field, namely,(i) the theoretical framework, ranging from linking theory to theta roles, Levin\u2019s classes and frame semantics;(ii) computational models based on syntactic representations derived from diverse parsing paradigms;(iii) several resources in different languages;(iv) many machine learning approaches and strategies; and (v) portability to other languages and domains.This book is mainly directed to practitioners who want to contribute to SRL or who want to simply use its technology in natural language applications.

We address the problem of finding the best parsing strategy for a rule, in terms of space and time complexity. We show that it is NP-hard to find the binary strategy with the lowest space complexity. We also show that any algorithm for finding the strategy with the lowest time complexity would imply improved approximation algorithms for finding the treewidth of general graphs.",

In general, parsing with SCFGs takes space and time polynomial in the length of the input strings, but with the degree of the polynomial depending on the permutations of the SCFG rules. We consider linear parsing strategies, which add one nonterminal at a time. We show that for a given input permutation, the problems of finding the linear parsing strategy with the minimum space and time complexity are both NP-hard.",

    "abstract": "Semiring parsing is an elegant framework for describing parsers by using semiring weighted logic programs. In this paper we present a generalization of this concept: latent-variable semiring parsing. With our framework, any semiring weighted logic program can be latentified by transforming weights from scalar values of a semiring to rank-n arrays, or tensors, of semiring values, allowing the modelling of latent variables within the semiring parsing framework. Semiring is too strong a notion when dealing with tensors, and we have to resort to a weaker structure: a partial semiring. We prove that this generalization preserves all the desired properties of the original semiring framework while strictly increasing its expressiveness.",

Recent work has shown that a feasible alternative is to combine the partial captions of ordinary typists, each of whom is able to type only part of what they hear. In this paper, we extend the state of the art fixed-window alignment algorithm (Naim et al., 2013) for combining the individual captions into a final output sequence. Our method performs alignment on a sliding window of the input sequences, drastically reducing both the number of errors and the latency of the system to the end user over the previously published approaches.",

    "title": "Efficient factorization of synchronous context-free grammars",
    "abstract": "Synchronous Context Free Grammar is a generalization of the context-free grammar formalism to simultaneously produce strings in two languages. Given two strings from a parallel corpus, word-level alignment can be performed in this framework through synchronous parsing. Variations of this idea go back to Aho and Ullman (1972)\u2019s Syntax-Directed Translation Systems, but also include Wu (1997)\u2019s Inversion Transduction Grammar, which restricts grammar rules to be binary, as well as tree-transformation models of translation such as Yamada and Knight (2001), Galley et al.(2004), and Chiang (2005). Extensions to the formal power of Synchronous Context Free Grammar, which we will not discuss further in this paper, include Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars (Shieber and Schabes, 1990), as well as Generalized Multitext Grammars (Melamed, Satta, and Wellington, 2004).In general, the language of permutations that a Synchronous Context Free Grammar (SCFG) can produce grows with the maximum number of nonterminals on the righthand side of the grammar\u2019s longest rule (Aho and Ullman, 1972). This means that the computational complexity of alignment (synchronous parsing) with such a grammar grows as O (Nn+ 4), polynomial in the sentence length N, but exponential in the grammar\u2019s maximum rule size n. However, a grammar with a maximum of n nonterminals in a rule may not include rules with all n! permutations. It may be possible to factor such a grammar into simpler a grammar with a maximum of k nonterminals in any one rule. This process is similar to binarization of a standard context free grammar into Chomsky Normal \u2026",

Biases for grammars with higher processing efficiency could be the direct result of abstract learning biases [83, 23] or they could result from the pressures of language use [11, 47, 48], such as preferences that have been hypothesized to operate during language production [33, 53, 65] or biases originating in comprehension [42, 76, 79, 90]. If language change is indeed subject to biases towards languages with higher processing efficiency and if these biases are sufficiently strong, these biases should over accumulate over historical time, leading natural languages that have existed for sufficiently long to have higher than expected processing efficiency [16, 55]. This is the primary hypothesis we set out to test. Some evidence suggests that the sound structure and lexicon of natural languages exhibit properties that are expected under this hypothesis [39, 72, 77, 78, 95]. At those levels of linguistic organization, studies over the last couple of years have also provided more direct correlational evidence that language change is affected by processing [91]. Miniature language learning experiments have documented similar biases during language acquisition and that these biases can accumulate over generations of learners [56].The level of linguistic organization that has remained elusive with regard to this question, however, is also arguably the one that is the one that makes human languages most unique compared to all other animal communication systems: syntax\u2013or some aspects of syntax (recursion \u2026",

Starting from the old idea of perception as probabilistic inference, we show how to use knowledge of the psychophysical task to make testable predictions for the influence of feedback signals on early sensory representations. Applying our framework to a two-alternative forced choice task paradigm, we can explain multiple empirical findings that have been hard to account for by the traditional feedforward model of sensory processing, including the task dependence of neural response correlations and the diverging time courses of choice probabilities and psychophysical kernels. Our model makes new predictions and characterizes a component of correlated variability that represents task-related information rather than performance \u2026",

Although choice probabilities have been measured extensively, their interpretation has remained fraught with difficulty. We derive the mathematical relationship between choice probabilities, read-out weights and correlated variability in the standard neural decision-making model. Our solution allowed us to prove and generalize earlier observations on the basis of numerical simulations and to derive new predictions. Notably, our results indicate how the read-out weight profile, or decoding strategy, can be inferred from experimentally measurable quantities. Furthermore, we developed a test to decide whether the decoding weights of individual neurons are optimal for the task, even without knowing the underlying correlations.

This is widely thought to reflect noise in shared afferents, in which case rsc can limit the reliability of sensory coding. However, it could also be due to feedback from higher-order brain regions. Currently, the relative contributions of these sources are unknown. We addressed this by recording from populations of V1 neurons in macaques performing different discrimination tasks involving the same visual input. We found that the structure of rsc (the way rsc varied with neuronal stimulus preference) changed systematically with task instruction. Therefore, even at the earliest stage in the cortical visual hierarchy, rsc structure during task performance primarily reflects feedback dynamics. Consequently, previous proposals for how rsc constrains sensory processing need not apply. Furthermore, we show that correlations \u2026",

Approximately 42% of the neurons we record from V1 of awake monkeys behave in this way (a powerful confirmation of the model), while about 58% deviate from the model in a manner that concentrates more of their dynamic range on stimuli that obey the constraints of binocular geometry.

    "abstract": "In theory, sensory perception should be more accurate when more neurons contribute to the representation of a stimulus. However, psychophysical experiments that use larger stimuli to activate larger pools of neurons sometimes report impoverished perceptual performance. To determine the neural mechanisms underlying these paradoxical findings, we trained monkeys to discriminate the direction of motion of visual stimuli that varied in size across trials, while simultaneously recording from populations of motion-sensitive neurons in cortical area MT. We used the resulting data to constrain a computational model that explained the behavioral data as an interaction of three main mechanisms: noise correlations, which prevented stimulus information from growing with stimulus size; neural surround suppression, which decreased sensitivity for large stimuli; and a read-out strategy that emphasized neurons with receptive fields near the stimulus center. These results suggest that paradoxical percepts reflect tradeoffs between sensitivity and noise in neuronal populations.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16167.001",

We determined the role of feedforward pathways to decision signals in MT by recording neuronal activity while monkeys performed motion and depth tasks. During each session, we reversibly inactivated V2 and V3, which provide feedforward input to MT that conveys more information about depth than motion. We thus monitored the choice-related activity of the same neuron both before and during V2/V3 inactivation. During inactivation, MT neurons became less predictive of decisions for the depth task but not the motion task, indicating that a feedforward pathway that gives rise to tuning preferences also contributes to decision signals.

    "abstract": "Making good decisions requires updating beliefs according to new evidence. This is a dynamical process that is prone to biases: in some cases, beliefs become entrenched and resistant to new evidence (leading to primacy effects), while in other cases, beliefs fade over time and rely primarily on later evidence (leading to recency effects). How and why either type of bias dominates in a given context is an important open question. Here, we study this question in classic perceptual decision-making tasks, where, puzzlingly, previous empirical studies differ in the kinds of biases they observe, ranging from primacy to recency, despite seemingly equivalent tasks. We present a new model, based on hierarchical approximate inference and derived from normative principles, that not only explains both primacy and recency effects in existing studies, but also predicts how the type of bias should depend on the statistics of stimuli in a given task. We verify this prediction in a novel visual discrimination task with human observers, finding that each observer\u2019s temporal bias changed as the result of changing the key stimulus statistics identified by our model. The key dynamic that leads to a primacy bias in our model is an overweighting of new sensory information that agrees with the observer\u2019s existing belief\u2014a type of \u2018confirmation bias\u2019. By fitting an extended drift-diffusion model to our data we rule out an alternative explanation for primacy effects due to bounded integration. Taken together, our results resolve a major discrepancy among existing perceptual decision-making studies, and suggest that a key source of bias in human decision-making is approximate \u2026",

Here, we derive predictions about how the average temporal weighting of the evidence depends on a subject's decision confidence in this model. To test these predictions empirically, we devised a method to infer decision confidence from pupil size in 2 male monkeys performing a disparity discrimination task.

    "title": "A probabilistic population code based on neural samples",
    "abstract": "Sensory processing is often characterized as implementing probabilistic inference: networks of neurons compute posterior beliefs over unobserved causes given the sensory inputs. How these beliefs are computed and represented by neural responses is much-debated (Fiser et al. 2010, Pouget et al. 2013). A central debate concerns the question of whether neural responses represent samples of latent variables (Hoyer & Hyvarinnen 2003) or parameters of their distributions (Ma et al. 2006) with efforts being made to distinguish between them (Grabska-Barwinska et al. 2013). A separate debate addresses the question of whether neural responses are proportionally related to the encoded probabilities (Barlow 1969), or proportional to the logarithm of those probabilities (Jazayeri & Movshon 2006, Ma et al. 2006, Beck et al. 2012). Here, we show that these alternatives--contrary to common assumptions--are not mutually exclusive and that the very same system can be compatible with all of them. As a central analytical result, we show that modeling neural responses in area V1 as samples from a posterior distribution over latents in a linear Gaussian model of the image implies that those neural responses form a linear Probabilistic Population Code (PPC, Ma et al. 2006). In particular, the posterior distribution over some experimenter-defined variable like\" orientation\" is part of the exponential family with sufficient statistics that are linear in the neural sampling-based firing rates.",

    "abstract": "A crucial part of developing mathematical models of how the brain works is the quantification of their success. One of the most widely-used metrics yields the percentage of the variance in the data that is explained by the model. Unfortunately, this metric is biased due to the intrinsic variability in the data. This variability is in principle unexplainable by the model. We derive a simple analytical modification of the traditional formula that significantly improves its accuracy (as measured by bias) with similar or better precision (as measured by mean-square error) in estimating the true underlying Variance Explained by the model class. Our estimator advances on previous work by a) accounting for the uncertainty in the noise estimate, b) accounting for overfitting due to free model parameters mitigating the need for a separate validation data set and c) adding a conditioning term. We apply our new estimator to binocular disparity tuning curves of a set of macaque V1 neurons and find that on a population level almost all of the variance unexplained by Gabor functions is attributable to noise.",

    "abstract": "Following earlier studies which showed that a sparse coding principle may explain the receptive field properties of complex cells in primary visual cortex, it has been concluded that the same properties may be equally derived from a slowness principle. In contrast to this claim, we here show that slowness and sparsity drive the representations towards substantially different receptive field properties. To do so, we present complete sets of basis functions learned with slow subspace analysis (SSA) in case of natural movies as well as translations, rotations, and scalings of natural images. SSA directly parallels independent subspace analysis (ISA) with the only difference that SSA maximizes slowness instead of sparsity. We find a large discrepancy between the filter shapes learned with SSA and ISA. We argue that SSA can be understood as a generalization of the Fourier transform where the power spectrum corresponds to the maximally slow subspace energies in SSA. Finally, we investigate the trade-off between slowness and sparseness when combined in one objective function.",

    "title": "Task-induced neural covariability as a signature of approximate Bayesian learning and inference",
    "abstract": "Perception is often characterized computationally as an inference process in which uncertain or ambiguous sensory inputs are combined with prior expectations. Although behavioral studies have shown that observers can change their prior expectations in the context of a task, robust neural signatures of task-specific priors have been elusive. Here, we analytically derive such signatures under the general assumption that the responses of sensory neurons encode posterior beliefs that combine sensory inputs with task-specific expectations. Specifically, we derive predictions for the task-dependence of correlated neural variability and decision-related signals in sensory neurons. The qualitative aspects of our results are parameter-free and specific to the statistics of each task. The predictions for correlated variability also differ from predictions of classic feedforward models of sensory processing and are therefore a strong test of theories of hierarchical Bayesian inference in the brain. Importantly, we find that Bayesian learning predicts an increase in so-called \u201cdifferential correlations\u201d as the observer\u2019s internal model learns the stimulus distribution, and the observer\u2019s behavioral performance improves. This stands in contrast to classic feedforward encoding/decoding models of sensory processing, since such correlations are fundamentally information-limiting. We find support for our predictions in data from existing neurophysiological studies across a variety of tasks and brain areas. Finally, we show in simulation how measurements of sensory neural responses can reveal information about a subject\u2019s internal beliefs about the task. Taken together, our \u2026",

As such, a central goal of computational psychiatry is to ascribe the heterogenous phenotypes observed in ASD to a limited set of canonical computations that may have gone awry in the disorder. Here, we posit causal inference \u2013 the process of inferring a causal structure linking sensory signals to hidden world causes \u2013 as one such computation. We show that audio-visual integration is intact in ASD and in line with optimal models of cue combination, yet multisensory behavior is anomalous in ASD because this group operates under an internal model favoring integration (vs. segregation). Paradoxically, during explicit reports of common cause across spatial or temporal disparities, individuals with ASD were less and not more likely to report common cause, particularly at small cue disparities. Formal model fitting revealed differences in both the prior probability for common cause (p-common) and choice biases, which are dissociable in implicit but not explicit causal inference tasks. Together, this pattern of results suggests (i) different internal models in attributing world causes to sensory signals in ASD relative to neurotypical individuals given identical sensory cues, and (ii) the presence of an explicit compensatory mechanism in ASD, with these individuals putatively having learned to compensate for their bias to integrate in explicit reports.",

    "abstract": "A key role of sensory processing is integrating information across space. Neuronal responses in the visual system are influenced by both local features in the receptive field center and contextual information from the surround. While center-surround interactions have been extensively studied using simple stimuli like gratings, investigating these interactions with more complex, ecologically-relevant stimuli is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the stimulus space. We used large-scale neuronal recordings in mouse primary visual cortex to train convolutional neural network (CNN) models that accurately predicted center-surround interactions for natural stimuli. These models enabled us to synthesize surround stimuli that strongly suppressed or enhanced neuronal responses to the optimal center stimulus, as confirmed by in vivo experiments. In contrast to the common notion that congruent center and surround stimuli are suppressive, we found that excitatory surrounds appeared to complete spatial patterns in the center, while inhibitory surrounds disrupted them. We quantified this effect by demonstrating that CNN-optimized excitatory surround images have strong similarity in neuronal response space with surround images generated by extrapolating the statistical properties of the center, and with patches of natural scenes, which are known to exhibit high spatial correlations. Our findings cannot be explained by theories like redundancy reduction or predictive coding previously linked to contextual modulation in visual cortex.

    "abstract": "Our question is how the primate brain combines generative models and direct discriminative computations in high-level vision. Both approaches aim at inferring behaviorally relevant latent variables y from visual data x. In a probabilistic setting, the inference of the posterior p(y|x) is known as discriminative inference. The two approaches differ in how discriminative inference is implemented. In the generative approach, a model of the joint distribution p(y,x) of the latent variables and the visual input is employed. This model captures information about the processes in the world that give rise to the sensory data. Approximate inference algorithms are then used to infer the posterior over the latents given an image by estimating p(y|x) = p(y,x)/p(x). In the direct discriminative approach, a direct mapping from the sensory data to the posterior over the latents p(y|x) is learned without the use of an explicit generative model. The generative approach enables unsupervised learning of the structure of the world and promises better generalization to novel situations (statistical efficiency). Direct discriminative computations promise faster inferences (computational efficiency) that are accurate for new samples from the distribution experienced in training. In practice, inference of the full posterior may not be realistic and the visual system may settle for point estimates in certain cases.",

Previous studies of multisensory integration have suggested that the brain\u2019s integration of cues is well-approximated by an ideal observer implementing Bayesian causal inference. However, behavioral data from tasks that include only one stimulus in each modality fail to capture what is in nature a complex process. Here we employed an auditory spatial discrimination task in which listeners were asked to determine on which side they heard one of two concurrently presented sounds. We compared two visual conditions in which task-uninformative shapes were presented in the center of the screen, or spatially aligned with the auditory stimuli. We found that performance on the auditory task improved when the visual stimuli were spatially aligned with the auditory stimuli\u2014even though the shapes provided no information about which side the auditory target was on. We also demonstrate that a model of a Bayesian ideal observer performing causal inference cannot explain this improvement, demonstrating that humans deviate systematically from the ideal observer model.",

Starting from the old idea of perception as probabilistic inference, we show how to use knowledge of the psychophysical task to make easily testable predictions for the impact that feedback signals have on early sensory representations. Applying our framework to the well-studied two-alternative forced choice task paradigm, we can explain multiple empirical findings that have been hard to account for by the traditional feedforward model of sensory processing, including the task-dependence of neural response correlations, and the diverging time courses of choice probabilities and psychophysical kernels. Our model makes a number of new predictions and, importantly, characterizes a component of correlated variability that represents task-related information rather than performance-degrading noise. It also demonstrates a normative way to integrate sensory and cognitive components into physiologically testable mathematical models of perceptual decision-making.",

Here, we develop a general framework where approximations are stochastic mixtures of simple component distributions. Both sampling and VI can be seen as special cases: in sampling, each mixture component is a delta-function and is chosen stochastically, while in standard VI a single component is chosen to minimize divergence. We derive a practical method that interpolates between sampling and VI by analytically solving an optimization problem over a mixing distribution. Intermediate inference methods then arise by varying a single parameter. Our method provably improves on sampling (reducing variance) and on VI (reducing bias+ variance despite increasing variance). We demonstrate our method\u2019s bias/variance trade-off in practice on reference problems, and we compare outcomes to commonly used sampling and VI methods.

We develop new tools, including refined analyses of CPs and generalized linear models with stimulus-choice interactions, which accurately assess the stimulus- or choice-driven signals of each neuron, characterizing stimulus-dependent patterns of choice-related signals. With these tools, we analyze CPs of macaque MT neurons during a motion discrimination task.

    "title": "Inferring the brain\u2019s internal model from sensory responses in a probabilistic inference framework",
    "abstract": "During perception, the brain combines information received from its senses with prior information about the outside world . The mathematical concept of probabilistic inference has previously been suggested as a framework for understanding both perception (; ; ) and cognition . Whether this framework can explain not only behavior but also the underlying neural computations has been an open question. We propose that sensory neurons\u2019 activity represents a central quantity of Bayesian computations: posterior beliefs about the outside world. As a result, sensory responses, just like the beliefs themselves, should depend both on sensory inputs and on prior information represented in other parts of the brain. We show that this dependence on internal variables induces variability in sensory responses that \u2013 in the context of a psychophysical task \u2013 is related both to the structure of that task and to the neurons\u2019 stimulus tuning. We derive analytical predictions for the correlation between different neurons\u2019 responses, and for their correlation with behavior. Furthermore, we show that key neurophysiological observations from much studied perceptual discrimination and detection experiments agree with those predictions. Our work thereby provides a normative explanation for those observations, requiring a reinterpretation of the role of correlated variability for sensory coding. Finally, the fact that sensory responses (which we observe) are a product both of external inputs (which we control) and of internal beliefs, allows us to reverse-engineer information about the subject\u2019s internal beliefs by observing sensory neurons\u2019 responses alone.

Those signals, traditionally quantified as choice probabilities (CP), are well-understood in a feedforward framework assuming zero-signal trials with no choice bias. Here, we extend this understanding by analytically solving models of choice-related signals that account for informative stimuli, choice bias, and importantly, feedback signals reflecting either internal states, such as attention or belief, or the outcome of the decision process. First, we relate CPs to Choice Triggered Averages (CTAs), which quantify choice-related average changes in neural responses, and show that both have general expressions valid for activity-choice covariations of both feedforward or feedback origin. These expressions allow a meaningful calculation of CPs across all trials, including non-zero signal trials. Second, we derive how CPs and CTAs depend on feedforward and feedback weights and on noise correlations under several plausible model architectures. Third, we examine different types of feedback signals, related to predictive coding, probabilistic inference, and attention, and we predict how CPs and CTAs depend in each case on the stimulus signal level and on the neural tuning properties. Finally, we show that measuring both CPs and CTAs offers complementary information about the origin of choice-related signals, especially when studying temporal changes of activity-choice covariations across the trial time.

The derivation assumed that behavioral reports are distributed evenly between the two possible choices. This assumption is often violated in empirical data - especially when computing so-called grand CPs combining data across stimulus conditions. Here, we extend our analytical results to situations when subjects show clear biases towards one choice over the other, e.g. in non-zero signal conditions. Importantly, this also extends our results from discrimination tasks to detection tasks and detect probabilities for which much empirical data is available. We find that CPs and DPs depend monotonously on the fraction, p, of choices assigned to the more likely option: CPs and DPs are smallest for p equal to 0.5 and increase as p increases, i.e. as the data deviates from the ideal, zero-signal, unbiased scenario. While this deviation is small, our results suggest a) an empirical test for the feedforward framework and b) a way in which to correct choice probability and detect probability measurements before combining different stimulus conditions to increase signal/noise.",

We used Utah arrays to record activity from populations of primary visual cortex (V1) neurons from two macaque monkeys that were trained to switch between two coarse orientation-discrimination tasks. Surprisingly, we find no evidence for significant trial-by-trial changes in noise \u2026",

    "abstract": "The activity of cortical neurons in sensory areas covaries with perceptual decisions, a relationship often quantified by choice probabilities. While choice probabilities have been measured extensively, their interpretation has remained fraught with difficulty. Here, we derive the mathematical relationship between choice probabilities, read-out weights and noise correlations within the standard neural decision making model. Our solution allows us to prove and generalize earlier observations based on numerical simulations, and to derive novel predictions. Importantly, we show how the read-out weight profile, or decoding strategy, can be inferred from experimentally measurable quantities. Furthermore, we present a test to decide whether the decoding weights of individual neurons are optimal, even without knowing the underlying noise correlations.

However, a range of deviations from optimality demand an extension of this framework to characterize the different sources of suboptimality.

Here, we formalize suboptimalities as part of the brain\u2019s probabilistic model of the task. Data from a traditional binary discrimination task cannot separate between different kinds of biases, or between sensory noise and approximate computations. We showed that this was possible using a recently developed causal inference task in which observers discriminated auditory cues in the presence of choice-uninformative visual cues. An extension of the task with different stimulus durations provided evidence for an increase in the precision of the computations with stimulus duration, separate from a decrease in observation noise.",

Recently, we showed that during sequential perceptual decision-making, those conditions induce characteristic temporal biases that depend on the balance of sensory and category information present in the stimulus. Here, we show that the same model makes predictions for when observers will be over-confident and when they will be under-confident with respect to a Bayesian observer. We tested these predictions by collecting new data in a dual-report decision-making task. We found that for most participants the bias in confidence judgments changed in the predicted direction for stimulus changes that led them from over-weighting early evidence to equal weighting of evidence or over-weighting of late evidence. Our results suggest that approximate hierarchical inference might provide the computational basis for biases beyond low-level perceptual decision-making, including those affecting higher level cognitive functions like confidence judgements.",

Applied to multiple visual elements it leads to a \u201cchunking\u201d of these elements into groups, and groups of groups, with the goal to make the relative speed of as many of the elements zero with respect to the group they are inferred to belong to. As a result, our model infers individual motion relative to a group, and accounts for any inferred self-motion based on optic flow.

Multisensory integration is often modeled by ideal Bayesian causal inference, a model proposing that perceptual decisions arise from a statistical weighting of information from each sensory modality based on its reliability and relevance to the observer\u2019s task. However, ideal Bayesian causal inference fails to describe human behavior in a simultaneous auditory spatial discrimination task in which spatially aligned visual stimuli improve performance despite providing no information about the correct response. This work tests the hypothesis that humans weight auditory and visual information in this task based on their relative reliabilities, even though the visual stimuli are task-uninformative, carrying no information about the correct response, and should be given zero weight. Listeners perform an auditory spatial discrimination task with relative reliabilities modulated by the stimulus durations. By comparing conditions in which task-uninformative visual stimuli are spatially aligned with auditory stimuli or centrally located (control condition), listeners are shown to have a larger multisensory effect when their auditory thresholds are worse. Even in cases in which visual stimuli are not task-informative, the brain combines sensory information that is scene-relevant, especially when the task is difficult due to unreliable auditory information.",

This early psychophysical weighting has been explained by an integration-to-bound decision process, in which the stimulus is ignored after the accumulated evidence reaches a certain bound, or confidence level. Here, we derive predictions about how the average temporal weighting of the evidence depends on a subject\u2019s decision-confidence in this model. To test these predictions empirically, we devised a method to infer decision-confidence from pupil size in monkeys performing a disparity discrimination task. Our animals\u2019 data confirmed the integration-to-bound predictions, with different internal decision-bounds accounting for differences between animals. However, the data could not be explained by two alternative accounts for early psychophysical weighting: attractor dynamics either within the decision area or due to feedback to sensory areas, or a feedforward account due to neuronal response adaptation. This approach also opens the door to using confidence more broadly when studying the neural basis of decision-making.",

Here, we present a new method and prove conditions for its validity, that overcomes these challenges for a wide class of probabilistic encodings -- including the two major classes of neural sampling and distributed distributional codes. Our method tests whether the relationships between the model posteriors for different stimuli match the relationships between the corresponding neural responses -- akin to representational similarity analysis (RSA), a widely used method for nonprobabilistic models. Finally, we present a new model comparison diagnostic for our method, based not on the agreement of the model with the data directly, but on the alignment of the model and data when injecting noise in our neural prediction generation method. We illustrate our method using simulated V1 data and compare two Bayesian models that are practically indistinguishable using behavior alone.

    "abstract": "Elucidating the neural basis of perceptual biases, such as those produced by visual illusions, can provide powerful insights into the neural mechanisms of perceptual inference. However, studying the subjective percepts of animals poses a fundamental challenge: unlike human participants, animals cannot be verbally instructed to report what they see, hear, or feel. Instead, they must be trained to perform a task for reward, and researchers must infer from their responses what the animal perceived. However, animals' responses are shaped by reward feedback, thus raising the major concern that the reward regimen may alter the animal's decision strategy or even intrinsic perceptual biases. We developed a method that estimates perceptual bias during task performance and then computes the reward for each trial based on the evolving estimate of the animal's perceptual bias. Our approach makes use of multiple stimulus contexts to dissociate perceptual biases from decision-related biases. Starting with an informative prior, our Bayesian method updates a posterior over the perceptual bias after each trial. The prior can be specified based on data from past sessions, thus reducing the variability of the online estimates and allowing it to converge to a stable estimate over a small number of trials. After validating our method on synthetic data, we apply it to estimate perceptual biases of monkeys in a motion direction discrimination task in which varying background optic flow induces robust perceptual biases. This method overcomes an important challenge to understanding the neural basis of subjective percepts.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual representations of tactile motion are thought to emerge from computations that integrate cutaneous cues such as direction, speed, and saliency of the object moving on the skin. However, this knowledge was accrued from studies that presented stimuli with the hand in a fixed proprioceptive state. We studied how perception of tactile motion is modulated by proprioception, and how interactions between proprioceptive and tactile motion inputs are controlled by the reference frame of motion judgements. Participants judged the direction of motion of stimuli presented to their index finger in two reference frames (relative to the hand or their sternum) while the stimulated hand was placed in different positions. Our data show that tactile motion can be flexibly perceived in different reference frames, with proprioceptive modulations occurring only for motion judgements made in a Sternum-centric reference frame. We developed a Bayesian model that robustly accounts for the perceptual decisions of participants. Taken together, our data highlight the flexibility of the brain to represent tactile motion information in different coordinate systems. Our study also provides a computational framework for how task-dependent reference frame signals regulate the integration of proprioceptive and tactile inputs to generate flexible perception of tactile motion.",

Threshold measurement is the predominant approach in psychophysics that excels at quantifying stimulus strength required for accurate perceptual decisions. In parallel, reaction time (RT) paradigms along with associated accumulation-to-bound models have been used to estimate components of perceptual decision making (eg, decision time, non-decision time, and drift rate). It is unknown, however, whether both approaches yield the same conclusion about the sensitivity of the sensory system. To answer this question, we conducted two experiments (total n= 23) where we estimated both RTs and duration thresholds for a motion and a static discrimination task. Duration threshold (DT) is defined as the shortest stimulus presentation duration sufficient to make accurate perceptual decisions. RTs and choices were fitted \u2026",

To quantitatively test the causal inference predictions and constrain model parameters, we designed a new motion estimation task that overcomes two shortcomings of prior experiments. First, in our design, perceiving retinal motion vs integrating motion signals is reflected in strikingly different behavioral reports. Second, it probes the perception of motion of an object relative to a larger object that itself is perceived to move relative to an even larger object.

These processes, collectively known as multisensory integration, have been modeled as Bayesian causal inference, which proposes that perception involves the combination of information from different sensory modalities based on their reliability and their likelihood of stemming from the same causes in the outside world. Bayesian causal inference has explained a variety of multisensory effects in simple tasks but is largely untested in complex sensory scenes where multisensory integration can provide the most benefit. Recently, we presented data challenging the ideal Bayesian model from a new auditory spatial discrimination task in which spatially aligned visual stimuli improve performance despite providing no information about the correct response. Here, we tested the hypothesis that, despite deviating from the ideal observer, the influence of task-uninformative stimuli was still dependent on the reliabilities of auditory and visual cues. We reasoned shorter stimulus durations should lead to less reliable auditory spatial encoding, and hence stronger effects of more reliable visual cues, which are easily localized even at short durations. While our results replicated the effect from our previous study across a wide range of stimulus durations, we did not find a significant increase in effect size with shorter stimuli, leaving our principal question not fully answered.",

Thus, it is key to study whether tactile motion perception is transformed by hand position, and whether these transformations depend on the reference frame in which the motion judgement is made.

We compared two visual conditions in which task-uninformative shapes were presented in the center of the screen, or spatially aligned with the auditory stimuli. We found that performance on the auditory task improved when the visual stimuli were spatially aligned with the auditory stimuli\u2014even though the shapes provided no information about which side the auditory target was on.

    "abstract": "When monkeys make a perceptual decision about ambiguous visual stimuli, individual sensory neurons in MT and other areas have been shown to covary with the decision. This observation suggests that the response variability in those very neurons causes the animal to choose one over the other option. However, the fact that sensory neurons are correlated has greatly complicated attempts to link those covariances (and the associated choice probabilities) to a direct involvement of any particular neuron in a decision-making task. Here we report on an analytical treatment of choice probabilities in a population of correlated sensory neurons read out by a linear decoder. We present a closed-form solution that links choice probabilities, noise correlations and decoding weights for the case of fixed integration time. This allowed us to analytically prove and generalize a prior numerical finding about the choice probabilities being only due to the difference between the correlations within and between decision pools (Nienborg Cumming 2010) and derive simplified expressions for a range of interesting cases. We investigated the implications for plausible correlation structures like pool-based and limited-range correlations. We found that the relationship between choice probabilities and decoding weights is in general non-monotonic and highly sensitive to the underlying correlation structure. In fact, given empirical measures of the interneuronal correlations and CPs, our formulas allow to infer the individual neuronal decoding weights. We confirmed the feasibility of this approach using synthetic data. We then applied our analytical results to a published \u2026",

Learning representations that are invariant against such appearance changes can be viewed as an important preprocessing step which removes distracting variance from a data set, so that downstream classifiers or regression estimators perform better. Complex cells in primary visual cortex are commonly seen as building blocks for such invariant image representations (eg Riesenhuber Poggio 2000). While complex cells, like simple cells, respond to edges of particular orientation they are less sensitive to the precise location of the edge. A variety of neural algorithms have been proposed that aim at explaining the response properties of complex cells as components of an invariant representation that is optimized for the spatio-temporal statistics of the visual input. For certain classes of transformations (eg translations, scalings, and rotations), it is possible to analytically derive features that are invariant under these transformations, and the design of such invariant features has been studied extensively in computer vision. The range of naturally occurring transformations, however, is much more variable and not precisely known. Thus, an analytical design of invariant features does not seem feasible. Instead one can seek to find features that may not be perfectly invariant anymore but which on average change as slowly as possible under the transformations occurring in the data (F\u00f6ldi\u00e1k 1991). The best known instantiation of this approach is slow feature analysis (SFA) which has been proposed to underlie the formation of complex \u2026",

    "abstract": "Integrating noisy sensory evidence over time is an essential feature of perception, and of perceptual decisionmaking. While ideal observer analyses have guided our understanding of its algorithmic and neural basis, behavior often deviates from optimality by being biased towards early evidence. Conflicting theories have been proposed to explain such a primacy effect. Algorithmic level theories include the integration of evidence only until an internal bound is reached, and a confirmation bias due to approximate hierarchical inference. Biophysical theories on Marr\u2019s implementation level include neural adaptation and attractor dynamics. Here, we tested these different hypotheses by measuring the strength of the primacy effect in a visual discrimination task across a range of time scales from total stimulus durations of 416ms to 1667ms, and for a range of evidence frame durations from 17ms to 83ms. We find the primacy effect to be invariant with respect to stimulus time, but not physical time. Furthermore, a lower influence of early evidence frames when they are very short argues against neural adaptation. Together, our results favor an algorithmic explanation as proposed by approximate hierarchical inference.",

Based on our previous work on a neural sampling based model of perceptual decision-making [3], we propose a new computational explanation for the confirmation bias that can be extended to higher cognitive processes.

We compare our model with a previous explanation [4] for the confirmation bias in low-level vision and present an empirical test that can distinguish between both models.

We demonstrate that the Layer-Peeled Model, albeit simple, inherits many characteristics of well-trained neural networks, thereby offering an effective tool for explaining and predicting common empirical patterns of deep-learning training. First, when working on class-balanced datasets, we prove that any solution to this model forms a simplex equiangular tight frame, which, in part, explains the recently discovered phenomenon of neural collapse [V.

This lightweight approach does not require additional training or fine-tuning and is not limited by the input length of LLMs. We evaluate the effectiveness of RR through extensive experiments with GPT-3 on three complex reasoning tasks: commonsense reasoning, temporal reasoning, and tabular reasoning. Our results show that RR can produce more faithful explanations and improve the performance of LLMs.",

Roughly speaking, a classifier is said to be locally elastic if its prediction at a feature vector $\\bx'$ is \\textit{not} significantly perturbed, after the classifier is updated via stochastic gradient descent at a (labeled) feature vector $\\bx$ that is \\textit{dissimilar} to $\\bx'$ in a certain sense. This phenomenon is shown to persist for neural networks with nonlinear activation functions through extensive simulations on real-life and synthetic datasets, whereas this is not observed in linear classifiers. In addition, we offer a geometric interpretation of local elasticity using the neural tangent kernel \\citep{jacot2018neural}. Building on top of local elasticity, we obtain pairwise similarity measures between feature vectors, which can be used for clustering in conjunction with -means. The effectiveness of the clustering algorithm on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets in turn corroborates the hypothesis of local elasticity of neural networks on real-life data. Finally, we discuss some implications of local elasticity to shed light on several intriguing aspects of deep neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Algorithmic stability is a key characteristic to ensure the generalization ability of a learning algorithm. Among different notions of stability,\\emph {uniform stability} is arguably the most popular one, which yields exponential generalization bounds. However, uniform stability only considers the worst-case loss change (or so-called sensitivity) by removing a single data point, which is distribution-independent and therefore undesirable. There are many cases that the worst-case sensitivity of the loss is much larger than the average sensitivity taken over the single data point that is removed, especially in some advanced models such as random feature models or neural networks. Many previous works try to mitigate the distribution independent issue by proposing weaker notions of stability, however, they either only yield polynomial bounds or the bounds derived do not vanish as sample size goes to infinity. Given that, we propose\\emph {locally elastic stability} as a weaker and distribution-dependent stability notion, which still yields exponential generalization bounds. We further demonstrate that locally elastic stability implies tighter generalization bounds than those derived based on uniform stability in many situations by revisiting the examples of bounded support vector machines, regularized least square regressions, and stochastic gradient descent.",

Thus, given a fixed budget, partly annotating each structure may provide the same level of supervision, while allowing for more structures to be annotated. We provide an information theoretic formulation for this perspective and use it, in the context of three diverse structured learning tasks, to show that learning from partial structures can sometimes outperform learning from complete ones.

    "title": "Foreseeing the benefits of incidental supervision",
    "abstract": "Real-world applications often require improved models by leveraging a range of cheap incidental supervision signals. These could include partial labels, noisy labels, knowledge-based constraints, and cross-domain or cross-task annotations -- all having statistical associations with gold annotations but not exactly the same. However, we currently lack a principled way to measure the benefits of these signals to a given target task, and the common practice of evaluating these benefits is through exhaustive experiments with various models and hyperparameters. This paper studies whether we can, in a single framework, quantify the benefits of various types of incidental signals for a given target task without going through combinatorial experiments. We propose a unified PAC-Bayesian motivated informativeness measure, PABI, that characterizes the uncertainty reduction provided by incidental supervision signals. We demonstrate PABI's effectiveness by quantifying the value added by various types of incidental signals to sequence tagging tasks. Experiments on named entity recognition (NER) and question answering (QA) show that PABI's predictions correlate well with learning performance, providing a promising way to determine, ahead of learning, which supervision signals would be beneficial.",

    "title": "Towards understanding the dynamics of the first-order adversaries",
    "abstract": "An acknowledged weakness of neural networks is their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations to the inputs. To improve the robustness of these models, one of the most popular defense mechanisms is to alternatively maximize the loss over the constrained perturbations (or called adversaries) on the inputs using projected gradient ascent and minimize over weights. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of the maximization step towards understanding the experimentally observed effectiveness of this defense mechanism. Specifically, we investigate the non-concave landscape of the adversaries for a two-layer neural network with a quadratic loss. Our main result proves that projected gradient ascent finds a local maximum of this non-concave problem in a polynomial number of iterations with high probability. To our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a convergence analysis of the first-order adversaries. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that, in the initial phase of adversarial training, the scale of the inputs matters in the sense that a smaller input scale leads to faster convergence of adversarial training and a \u201cmore regular\u201d landscape. Finally, we show that these theoretical findings are in excellent agreement with a series of experiments.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable performance boost of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms is a result of re-emergence of deep neural networks that have been applied in a diverse set of applications. The success of deep learning stems from relaxing the need for the non-trivial task of feature-engineering. However, this remarkable success is conditioned on manually annotating a large amount of data points to generate suitable training datasets to supervise training of these networks. Since manual data annotation is time-consuming and expensive in many applications, learning in data-scarce regimes has been a major recent area of research focus in machine learning (ML) and AI. Transferring and reusing knowledge from a related learning problem is a core strategy for addressing challenges of learning in data-scarce regimens. Transfer learning is not a new field in ML and several great survey exist on this topic [, , , , ]. However \u2026",

    "abstract": "Recognizing spatial relations and reasoning about them is essential in multiple applications including navigation, direction giving and human-computer interaction in general. Spatial relations between objects can either be explicit -- expressed as spatial prepositions, or implicit -- expressed by spatial verbs such as moving, walking, shifting, etc. Both these, but implicit relations in particular, require significant common sense understanding. In this paper, we introduce the task of inferring implicit and explicit spatial relations between two entities in an image. We design a model that uses both textual and visual information to predict the spatial relations, making use of both positional and size information of objects and image embeddings. We contrast our spatial model with powerful language models and show how our modeling complements the power of these, improving prediction accuracy and coverage and facilitates dealing with unseen subjects, objects and relations.",

    "abstract": "To comprehensively gauge the capacity of current models for complex reasoning, it is crucial to assess their step-by-step reasoning in a scalable manner. Established reference-based evaluation metrics rely on human-annotated reasoning chains as references to assess the model-derived chains. However, such \u201cgold-standard\u201d human-written reasoning chains may not be unique and their acquisition is often labor-intensive. Existing reference-free reasoning evaluation metrics, while eliminating the need for human-crafted reasoning chains as references, often require fine-tuning with human-derived chains before evaluation, complicating the process and questioning their adaptability to other datasets. To address these challenges, we harness GPT-4 to automatically evaluate reasoning chain quality, thereby removing the dependency on human-written reasoning chains for both model fine-tuning and evaluative purposes. Leveraging the Socratic method, we develop SocREval (** Soc** ratic Method-Inspired** R** easoning** Eval** uation), a novel approach for prompt design in reference-free reasoning evaluation. Empirical results from four human annotated datasets reveal that SocREval significantly improves GPT-4\u2019s performance, surpassing existing reference-free and reference-based reasoning evaluation metrics. Beyond its demonstrated efficacy, SocREval, proves to be both cost-efficient and robust to prompt writing and example selection, as substantiated by our in-depth analysis.",

    "abstract": "Prior knowledge and symbolic rules in machine learning are often expressed in the form of label constraints, especially in structured prediction problems. In this work, we compare two common strategies for encoding label constraints in a machine learning pipeline, regularization with constraints and constrained inference, by quantifying their impact on model performance. For regularization, we show that it narrows the generalization gap by precluding models that are inconsistent with the constraints. However, its preference for small violations introduces a bias toward a suboptimal model. For constrained inference, we show that it reduces the population risk by correcting a model\u2019s violation, and hence turns the violation into an advantage. Given these differences, we further explore the use of two approaches together and propose conditions for constrained inference to compensate for the bias introduced by regularization, aiming to improve both the model complexity and optimal risk.",

    "abstract": "Negation cue detection involves identifying the span inherently expressing negation in a negative sentence. In Chinese, negative cue detection is complicated by morphological proprieties of the language. Previous work has shown that negative cue detection in Chinese can benefit from specific lexical and morphemic features, as well as cross-lingual information. We show here that they are not necessary: A bi-directional LSTM can perform equally well, with minimal feature engineering. In particular, the use of a character-based model allows us to capture characteristics of negation cues in Chinese using word-embedding information only. Not only does our model performs on par with previous work, further error analysis clarifies what problems remain to be addressed.",

We discover that LLM's performance exceeds humans and surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods fine-tuned on extensive datasets in debate evaluation. We additionally explore and analyze biases present in LLMs, including positional bias, lexical bias, order bias, which may affect their evaluative judgments. Our findings reveal a consistent bias in both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 towards the second candidate response presented, attributed to prompt design. We also uncover lexical biases in both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, especially when label sets carry connotations such as numerical or sequential, highlighting the critical need for careful label verbalizer selection in prompt design. Additionally, our analysis indicates a tendency of both models to favor the debate's concluding side as the winner, suggesting an end-of-discussion bias.",

    "abstract": "Unraveling the intricate details of events in natural language necessitates a subtle understanding of temporal dynamics. Despite the adeptness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in discerning patterns and relationships from data, their inherent comprehension of temporal dynamics remains a formidable challenge. This research meticulously explores these intrinsic challenges within LLMs, with a specific emphasis on evaluating the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models in the analysis of temporal data. Employing two distinct prompt types, namely Question Answering (QA) format and Textual Entailment (TE) format, our analysis probes into both implicit and explicit events. The findings underscore noteworthy trends, revealing disparities in the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Notably, biases toward specific temporal relationships come to light, with GPT-3.5 demonstrating a preference for \"AFTER'' in the QA format for both implicit and explicit events, while GPT-4 leans towards \"BEFORE''. Furthermore, a consistent pattern surfaces wherein GPT-3.5 tends towards \"TRUE'', and GPT-4 exhibits a preference for \"FALSE'' in the TE format for both implicit and explicit events. This persistent discrepancy between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in handling temporal data highlights the intricate nature of inductive bias in LLMs, suggesting that the evolution of these models may not merely mitigate bias but may introduce new layers of complexity.",
