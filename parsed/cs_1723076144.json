    "title": "Using augmented reality to elicit pretend play for children with autism",
    "abstract": "Children with autism spectrum condition (ASC) suffer from deficits or developmental delays in symbolic thinking. In particular, they are often found lacking in pretend play during early childhood. Researchers believe that they encounter difficulty in generating and maintaining mental representation of pretense coupled with the immediate reality. We have developed an interactive system that explores the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) technology to visually conceptualize the representation of pretense within an open-ended play environment. Results from an empirical study involving children with ASC aged 4 to 7 demonstrated a significant improvement of pretend play in terms of frequency, duration and relevance using the AR system in comparison to a non computer-assisted situation. We investigated individual differences, skill transfer, system usability and limitations of the proposed AR system. We discuss \u2026",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing need to prepare young learners to be Artificial Intelligence (AI) capable for the future workforce and everyday life. Machine Learning (ML), as an integral subfield of AI, has become the new engine that revolutionizes practices of knowledge discovery. Making ML experience accessible to young learners, however, remains challenging due to its high demand for mathematical and computational skills. This research focuses on designing novel learning environments that help demystify ML technologies for K-12 students, and also investigating new opportunities for maximizing ML accessibility through integration with scientific discovery in STEM education. We developed SmileyCluster - a hands-on and collaborative learning environment that utilizes glyph-based data visualization and superposition comparative visualization to assist learning an entry-level ML technology, namely k-means \u2026",

    "abstract": "Lack of spontaneous pretend play is an early diagnostic indicator of autism spectrum conditions (ASC) along with impaired communication and social interaction. In a previous ISMAR poster [2] we proposed an Augmented Reality (AR) system to encourage pretend play, based on an analogy between imaginative interpretation of physical objects (pretense) and the superimposition of virtual content on the physical world in AR. This paper reports an empirical experiment evaluating that proposal, involving children between the ages of 4 and 7 who have been diagnosed with ASC. Results find significantly more pretend play, and higher engagement, using the AR system by comparison to a non-augmented condition. We also discuss usability issues and design implications for AR systems that aim to support children with ASC and other pervasive developmental disorders.",

We make a bipartite distinction between individual and interpersonal functions that contribute to curiosity, and multimodal behaviors that fulfill these functions.

In spite of the prevalence of small group learning in and outside of modern classrooms, little is known about the social nature of curiosity. In this paper, we present a model that predicts the temporal and social dynamics of curiosity based on sequences of behaviors exhibited by individuals engaged in group learning. This model reveals distinct sequential behavior patterns that predict increase and decrease of curiosity in individuals, and convergence to high and low curiosity among group members. In particular, convergence of the entire group to a state of high curiosity is highly correlated with sequences of behaviors that involve the most social of group behaviors - such as questions and answers, arguments and sharing findings, as well as scientific reasoning \u2026",

We enforce sparsity by imposing penalties based on the /spl lscr//sub 1/-norm. A number of recent theoretical results on sparsifying properties of /spl lscr//sub 1/ penalties justify this choice. Explicitly enforcing the sparsity of the representation is motivated by a desire to obtain a sharp estimate of the spatial spectrum that exhibits super-resolution. We propose to use the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix to summarize multiple time or frequency samples. Our formulation leads to an optimization problem, which we solve efficiently in a second-order cone (SOC) programming framework by an interior point implementation.

This paper surveys the use of sparse reconstruction algorithms and randomized measurement strategies in radar processing. Although the two themes have a long history in radar literature, the accessible framework provided by compressed sensing illuminates the impact of joining these themes.

The approach is based on a regularized reconstruction of the scattering field which combines a tomographic model of the SAR observation process with prior information regarding the nature of the features of interest. Compared to conventional SAR techniques, the method we propose produces images with increased resolution, reduced sidelobes, reduced speckle and easier-to-segment regions. Our technique effectively deals with the complex-valued, random-phase nature of the underlying SAR reflectivities. An efficient and robust numerical solution is achieved through extensions of half-quadratic regularization methods to the complex-valued SAR problem. We demonstrate the performance of the method on synthetic and real SAR scenes.",

This is necessary because the low-level arbiters of these shared resources are not typically designed to provide real-time guarantees. In this work, we introduce a novel system execution model, the Predictable Execution Model (PREM), which, in contrast to the standard COTS execution model, coschedules at a high level all active components in the system, such as CPU cores and I/O peripherals.

    "abstract": "Applications that process sensitive data can be carefully designed and validated to be difficult to attack, but they are usually run on monolithic, commodity operating systems, which may be less secure. An OS compromise gives the attacker complete access to all of an application's data, regardless of how well the application is built. We propose a new system, Virtual Ghost, that protects applications from a compromised or even hostile OS. Virtual Ghost is the first system to do so by combining compiler instrumentation and run-time checks on operating system code, which it uses to create ghost memory that the operating system cannot read or write. Virtual Ghost interposes a thin hardware abstraction layer between the kernel and the hardware that provides a set of operations that the kernel must use to manipulate hardware, and provides a few trusted services for secure applications such as ghost memory \u2026",

The nested kernel operating system architecture addresses this problem by \"nesting\" a small isolated kernel within a traditional monolithic kernel. The \"nested kernel\" interposes on all updates to virtual memory translations to assert protections on physical memory, thus significantly reducing the trusted computing base for memory access control enforcement. We incorporated the nested kernel architecture into FreeBSD on x86-64 hardware while allowing the entire operating system, including untrusted components, to operate at the highest hardware privilege level by write-protecting MMU translations and de-privileging the untrusted part of the kernel.

From the study, we find that nearly 82% of bug symptoms can be reproduced deterministically by re-running with the same set of inputs at the production site. We further find that very few input requests are needed to reproduce most failures; in fact, just one input request after session establishment suffices to reproduce the failure in nearly 77% of the cases.

    "abstract": "Systems that enforce memory safety for today\u2019s operating system kernels and other system software do not account for the behavior of low-level software/hardware interactions such as memory-mapped I/O, MMU configuration, and context switching. Bugs in such low-level interactions can lead to violations of the memory safety guarantees provided by a safe execution environment and can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities in system software. In this work, we present a set of program analysis and run-time instrumentation techniques that ensure that errors in these low-level operations do not violate the assumptions made by a safety checking system. Our design introduces a small set of abstractions and interfaces for manipulating processor state, kernel stacks, memory mapped I/O objects, MMU mappings, and self modifying code to achieve this goal, without moving resource allocation and management decisions out of the kernel. We have added these techniques to a compiler-based virtual machine called Secure Virtual Architecture (SVA), to which the standard Linux kernel has been ported previously. Our design changes to SVA required only an additional 100 lines of code to be changed in this kernel. Our experimental results show that our techniques prevent reported memory safety violations due to low-level Linux operations and that these violations are not prevented by SVA without our techniques. Moreover, the new techniques in this paper introduce very little overhead over and above the existing overheads of SVA. Taken together, these results indicate that it is clearly worthwhile to add these techniques to an existing memory safety system.",

Here locality is defined by the distance of data reuse. Studying whole-program data reuse may reveal global patterns not apparent in short-distance reuses or local control flow. However, the analysis must meet two requirements to be useful. The first is efficiency. It needs to analyze all accesses to all data elements in full-size benchmarks and to measure distance of any length and in any required precision. The second is predication. Based on a few training runs, it needs to classify patterns as regular and irregular and, for regular ones, it should predict their (changing) behavior for other inputs.

It then constructs a phase hierarchy through grammar compression. Finally, it inserts phase markers into the program using binary rewriting. When the instrumented program runs, it uses the first few executions of a phase to predict all its later executions.Compared with existing methods based on program code and execution intervals, locality phase prediction is unique because it uses locality profiles, and it marks phase boundaries in program code.

It is imperative to protect the entire address space during speculation.

We develop an audio-guided visual attention mechanism to explore audio-visual correlations, propose a dual multimodal residual network (DMRN) to fuse information over the two modalities, and introduce an audio-visual distance learning network to handle the cross-modality localization. Our experiments support the following findings: joint modeling of auditory and visual modalities outperforms independent modeling, the learned attention can capture semantics of sounding objects, temporal alignment is important for audio-visual fusion, the proposed DMRN is effective in fusing audio-visual features, and strong correlations between the two modalities enable cross-modality localization.",

Instead of learning a direct mapping from audio to video frames, we propose first to transfer audio to high-level structure, ie, the facial landmarks, and then to generate video frames conditioned on the landmarks. Compared to a direct audio-to-image approach, our cascade approach avoids fitting spurious correlations between audiovisual signals that are irrelevant to the speech content. We, humans, are sensitive to temporal discontinuities and subtle artifacts in video. To avoid those pixel jittering problems and to enforce the network to focus on audiovisual-correlated regions, we propose a novel dynamically adjustable pixel-wise loss with an attention mechanism. Furthermore, to generate a sharper image with well-synchronized facial movements, we propose a novel regression-based discriminator structure, which considers sequence-level information along with frame-level information. Thoughtful experiments on several datasets and real-world samples demonstrate significantly better results obtained by our method than the state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative comparisons.",

    "title": "Lip movements generation at a glance",
    "abstract": "Cross-modality generation is an emerging topic that aims to synthesize data in one modality based on information in a different modality. In this paper, we consider a task of such: given an arbitrary audio speech and one lip image of arbitrary target identity, generate synthesized lip movements of the target identity saying the speech. To perform well in this task, it inevitably requires a model to not only consider the retention of target identity, photo-realistic of synthesized images, consistency and smoothness of lip images in a sequence, but more importantly, learn the correlations between audio speech and lip movements. To solve the collective problems, we explore the best modeling of the audio-visual correlations in building and training a lip-movement generator network. Specifically, we devise a method to fuse audio and image embeddings to generate multiple lip images at once and propose a novel correlation loss to synchronize lip changes and speech changes. Our final model utilizes a combination of four losses for a comprehensive consideration in generating lip movements; it is trained in an end-to-end fashion and is robust to lip shapes, view angles and different facial characteristics. Thoughtful experiments on three datasets ranging from lab-recorded to lips in the wild show that our model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods extended to this task.",

    "abstract": "Cross-modal audio-visual perception has been a long-lasting topic in psychology and neurology, and various studies have discovered strong correlations in human perception of auditory and visual stimuli. Despite work on computational multimodal modeling, the problem of cross-modal audio-visual generation has not been systematically studied in the literature. In this paper, we make the first attempt to solve this cross-modal generation problem leveraging the power of deep generative adversarial training. Specifically, we use conditional generative adversarial networks to achieve cross-modal audio-visual generation of musical performances. We explore different encoding methods for audio and visual signals, and work on two scenarios: instrument-oriented generation and pose-oriented generation.

When defining the likelihood model, the proposed method models both spectral peaks and non-peak regions (frequencies further than a musical quarter tone from all observed peaks). It is shown that the peak likelihood and the non-peak region likelihood act as a complementary pair. The former helps find F0s that have harmonics that explain peaks, while the latter helps avoid F0s that have harmonics in non-peak regions. Parameters of these models are learned from monophonic and polyphonic training data. This paper proposes an iterative greedy search strategy to estimate F0s one by one, to avoid the combinatorial problem of concurrent F0 estimation. It also \u2026",

    "abstract": "Human voices can be used to authenticate the identity of the speaker, but the automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems are vulnerable to voice spoofing attacks, such as impersonation, replay, text-to-speech, and voice conversion. Recently, researchers developed anti-spoofing techniques to improve the reliability of ASV systems against spoofing attacks. However, most methods encounter difficulties in detecting unknown attacks in practical use, which often have different statistical distributions from known attacks. Especially, the fast development of synthetic voice spoofing algorithms is generating increasingly powerful attacks, putting the ASV systems at risk of unseen attacks. In this work, we propose an anti-spoofing system to detect unknown synthetic voice spoofing attacks (i.e., text-to-speech or voice conversion) using one-class learning.

It uses a musical score to guide the separation process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first online system that addresses score-informed music source separation that can be made into a real-time system. The proposed system consists of two parts: 1) a score follower that associates a score position to each time frame of the audio performance; 2) a source separator which reconstructs the source signals for each time frame, informed by the score. The score follower uses a hidden Markov approach, where each audio frame is associated with a 2-D state vector (score position and tempo).

Compared with other deep learning modalities, high-performance hardware acceleration of GCNs is as critical but even more challenging. The hurdles arise from the poor data locality and redundant computation due to the large size, high sparsity, and irregular non-zero distribution of real-world graphs. In this paper we propose a novel hardware accelerator for GCN inference, called I-GCN, that significantly improves data locality and reduces unnecessary computation. The mechanism is a new online graph restructuring algorithm we refer to as islandization. The proposed algorithm finds clusters of nodes with strong internal but weak external connections. The islandization process yields two major benefits. First, by processing islands rather than individual nodes, there is better on-chip data reuse and fewer off-chip \u2026",

Scaling CNN computations to larger clusters is generally done by distributing tasks in batch mode using methods such as distributed synchronous SGD. Among the issues with this approach is that, to make the distributed cluster work with high utilization, the workload distributed to each node must be large; this implies nontrivial growth in the SGD mini-batch size. In this article we propose a framework, called FPDeep, which uses a hybrid of model and layer parallelism to configure distributed reconfigurable clusters to train CNNs. This approach has numerous benefits. First, the design does not suffer from performance loss due to batch size growth.
